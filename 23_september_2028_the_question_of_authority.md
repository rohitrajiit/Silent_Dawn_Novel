### The Question of Authority

> *"A king protects you from the wolves, but who protects you from the king? We trade safety for obedience. Is the price too high?" — Anonymous pamphlet circulated in Haven, September 2028.*

**September 2028 — Haven, Tennessee**

The council meeting had been going for four hours, and Grace was tired of hearing herself talk.

"The question is simple," she said, for what felt like the hundredth time. "Do we join the Nashville Federation or not?"

The Nashville Federation was the largest organized authority in Tennessee—a coalition of communities centered on what remained of Nashville, led by the former mayor and a council of military and civilian leaders. They had sent an envoy to Haven two weeks ago, offering membership.

The terms were generous. Too generous, some said.

"They want our food production," Marcus Washington argued. "That's what this is about. They've got people but not enough farmland. We've got both. They'll take and take until there's nothing left."

"They're offering protection," countered Father Miguel. "Medical supplies. Skilled labor. Things we can't produce ourselves."

"Protection from what? We've managed fine on our own."

"For now. What happens when a larger threat emerges? What happens when the next raider band isn't a hundred people but a thousand?"

"Then we need stronger leadership here, not subservience to Nashville."

The voice came from the back of the room—Samuel Torres, Haven's security coordinator. He worked under Marcus but had never spoken at a council meeting before. Former LAPD, twenty years on the force before the Event. He had walked from California with a group of refugees, losing half of them along the way. The experience had hardened something in him that had perhaps always been hard.

Grace raised an eyebrow. "You have something to add, Samuel?"

"I have a question." Torres stepped forward, his arms crossed. "Why are we pretending this is a democracy?"

The room went still.

"We call ourselves a council," Torres continued. "We talk about 'the community' like it's some kind of voting body. But let's be honest about what happened during the Starving Time. When the grain ran low, who decided the rationing quotas? When the Hendricks family refused to share their private stores, who decided to confiscate them? When we had to choose which of the sick got the last antibiotics—did we hold a town meeting?"

"Those were emergency decisions," Marcus said. "We did what we had to do."

"Exactly. We did what we had to do. We—this council—made life and death choices without anyone's permission. And it worked. Haven survived." Torres looked directly at Grace. "Sixty-one people are alive today because you made hard calls without waiting for consensus. Why are we suddenly pretending that's a bad thing?"

Maya listened, her mind racing. She had been thinking about governance ever since the envoy arrived—about what it meant to create authority, to legitimize power, to build structures that would outlast the people who created them.

The old world had solved these problems in ways they now took for granted. Elections. Constitutions. Checks and balances. The slow accumulation of norms and institutions over centuries.

All of that was gone. They were starting from scratch—not just in terms of technology, but in terms of the social technologies that made large-scale cooperation possible.

"May I say something?" she asked.

Grace nodded. "Dr. Chen."

Maya stood. "We're asking the wrong question. It's not about whether we join the Federation or not. It's about what kind of community we want to be. What kind of governance we want to have."

"We have governance," Grace said. "We have this council."

"Yes. A council that I'm on because I was useful when the caravan formed. That Marcus is on because he knew how to fight. That Father Miguel is on because people trust him." Maya looked around the table. "Did anyone elect us? Did anyone agree that we should make decisions for them?"

Silence.

Torres broke it. "They agreed by surviving. They agreed by following the rules we set. That's the oldest form of consent there is—obedience in exchange for protection."

"That's not consent," Maya said. "That's coercion dressed up in philosophy."

"Is it?" Torres leaned against the wall, his expression unreadable. "Dr. Chen, you're a scientist. You believe in evidence. So let me give you some. During the Starving Time, I tracked mortality rates across every community the runners brought news from. The pattern was clear. Communities with strong, centralized leadership—even harsh leadership—had lower mortality than communities that operated by consensus."

"Garrett Hollis made the same argument in Indianapolis," Father Miguel said quietly. "His compound had eight percent mortality."

"And Haven?" Torres asked.

No one answered. They all knew. Twenty-nine percent of the elderly. Eighteen percent of children under five. Lower than many, but still—those were people. Names. Faces.

"The question isn't whether unilateral authority saves lives in a crisis," Torres pressed. "The evidence says it does. The question is whether we're willing to admit that, or whether we'd rather feel good about our principles while we dig more graves."

Maya felt the argument shifting beneath her, the ground less solid than she'd assumed. She looked at Grace, hoping for support, and found something unexpected in the older woman's face.

Exhaustion. And guilt.

"I'm not criticizing what we've built," Maya said, more carefully now. "It worked. It kept people alive. But we're past survival now. We're building something meant to last. And if we want it to last, we need legitimacy. We need people to believe in the structures, not just the individuals."

"What are you suggesting?" Grace asked.

"I'm suggesting we call an assembly. Everyone in Haven. Let them decide—not just about the Federation, but about how decisions should be made. Who should lead. What the rules should be." Maya sat back down. "If we make this choice for them, we're no better than the authorities they fled. If we let them make it for themselves, we're building something real."

Torres shook his head. "And when the next crisis comes? When there's no time for assemblies and votes? What then?"

"Then we face that crisis with leaders the community chose," Maya said. "Leaders who have legitimacy because they were granted power, not because they seized it in an emergency."

"Pretty words. I hope they keep you warm when the raiders come."

The debate continued for another hour, but the fault lines were clear now. When they finally voted on Maya's proposal, it passed—narrowly. Four to two, with Torres abstaining.

As the others filed out, Grace caught Maya's arm.

"Walk with me."

They stepped outside into the September evening, the air still warm but carrying the first hints of autumn. Grace didn't speak until they were well away from the main buildings, following a path toward the apple orchard.

"He's not wrong," Grace said finally. "Torres."

"About democracy being dangerous?"

"About what I did." Grace stopped walking, staring at the darkening trees. "The Hendricks family. The antibiotics. The rationing quotas. I made those decisions, Maya. Not the council—me. Marcus backed me up, Father Miguel prayed over the outcomes, but the choices were mine. I didn't ask permission. I didn't wait for consensus. I just... decided who would eat and who would go hungry. Who would get medicine and who would have to fight their infections alone."

"You saved lives."

"I saved some lives. I ended others." Grace's voice was flat, matter-of-fact. "The Hendricks—they had three children. When I ordered their stores confiscated, the father tried to fight. Marcus had to restrain him. They left Haven the next day. I don't know if they survived the winter."

Maya didn't know what to say. She had imagined the Starving Time as a collective struggle, difficult but shared. She hadn't imagined the specific, individual weight of the decisions that had carried them through.

"The assembly you're proposing," Grace continued. "The charter, the elections, all of it—you're right that we need legitimacy. But don't pretend we're clean. Don't pretend this is a fresh start." She turned to face Maya. "Whatever we build now, it's built on a foundation of choices we made without anyone's consent. Choices we can't take back. The best we can do is try to be better going forward."

"Is that enough?"

"I don't know." Grace resumed walking. "But it's what we have."

The debate continued for days after the council meeting, but the idea had taken root. By the end of the week, they had agreed: Haven would hold its first democratic assembly. And when it convened, Torres would be there—watching, skeptical, waiting for the moment when beautiful ideals met ugly reality once again.

---

The assembly was held three weeks later, in the largest barn on the property.

Two hundred and thirty-seven people. Every adult in Haven. They sat on haybales and wooden benches and the bare ground, and they talked. For eight hours, they talked.

They talked about the Federation—whether to join, what terms to demand, what risks they faced either way.

They talked about the council—whether it should continue, how members should be chosen, what powers they should have.

They talked about rights and responsibilities—what every person in Haven owed to the community, and what the community owed to them.

It was messy. It was frustrating. It took forever.

And when it was over, they had a charter.

**The Haven Charter:**

We, the people of Haven, establish this charter to secure our common welfare and preserve our liberty.

**Article I: Sovereignty.** All authority derives from the people of Haven. No person or body may exercise power except as granted by this charter and the consent of the governed.

**Article II: The Assembly.** The full Assembly of all adult residents shall meet quarterly to decide matters of common concern. A two-thirds majority shall be required for decisions affecting the fundamental rights of residents.

**Article III: The Council.** A Council of seven members shall be elected annually to handle day-to-day governance. The Council may not exceed the authority granted by the Assembly.

**Article IV: Rights.** Every resident of Haven possesses inherent rights that no authority may violate: the right to speak freely, to practice their faith, to own property, to fair treatment under agreed rules, and to leave the community without penalty.

**Article V: Obligations.** Every adult resident shall contribute to the common defense and welfare according to their means. In times of crisis, the Assembly may expand these obligations by two-thirds vote.

**Article VI: Amendments.** This charter may be amended by a three-fourths vote of the full Assembly.

It was imperfect. There were gaps and ambiguities. There would be disputes about interpretation.

But it was theirs. The people of Haven had created their own government, by consensus, through deliberation. They had done what humans had done countless times throughout history—come together to establish rules for living together.

As for the Federation: they voted to negotiate, but not to join outright. Maya was appointed to lead the delegation. She would spend the next three months working out terms that preserved Haven's autonomy while securing the benefits of cooperation.
