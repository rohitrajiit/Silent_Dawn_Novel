**September 12, 2027 — Mumbai**

While other parts of the city descended into chaos, Dharavi organized.

Arjun had ventured out on Day Five, driven by the need for information and the dwindling supplies in his apartment. What he found in Asia's largest slum was the opposite of what he had expected.

Dharavi had always been self-sufficient in ways that the rest of Mumbai—the formal Mumbai, the air-conditioned Mumbai—had never understood. The leather workers and potters and recyclers and tailors who lived in its narrow lanes had built a parallel economy that depended minimally on digital systems. Their supply chains were human. Their transactions were personal. Their resilience was inherited from generations of survival.

"You are looking lost, beta," said an old woman sitting outside a corner shop. She was selling chai—impossibly, wonderfully, the smell of tea and ginger and cardamom still filled the air. "First time in Dharavi?"

"How—" Arjun stared at the kerosene stove she was using, the old brass kettle. "How do you have supplies?"

"We always have supplies." She handed him a small clay cup without asking for payment. "When you live without the things rich people take for granted, you learn to prepare. Sit. Drink. You look like you haven't eaten."

He sat. He drank. The chai was the best thing he had ever tasted.

"My name is Arjun. I'm from Bandra."

"Bandra!" She laughed. "Fancy boy. I am Kamala-mausi. Everyone calls me that. What is happening in Bandra?"

"It's bad. Fights over water. The buildings—nobody knows how to live without elevators, without pumps..." He trailed off. "You don't have those problems here."

"No. We have other problems. Old problems. But old problems, we know how to handle." She poured herself a cup. "Stay here today. Help with the distribution. Everyone works, everyone eats. That is the rule."

Arjun spent a week in Dharavi.

He learned things that no computer science degree had taught him. How to collect rainwater and filter it through sand and charcoal. How to cook rice with minimal fuel. How to organize people without Slack or Trello or any project management software—just voices and trust and the ancient Indian skill of jugaad, making things work with whatever was available.

The community had set up a system. Each lane had a coordinator. Resources were pooled and distributed. The potters made containers. The metalworkers repaired tools. The tailors patched clothes. Everyone had a role.

"You," Kamala-mausi said on his third day, "what can you do?"

"I write code. Software. It's..."

"Useless now, yes. What else?"

"I..." Arjun thought. "I can do math. I was always good at logistics, at optimization. Figuring out how to make systems more efficient."

"Good. You will help with rationing. We need someone who can count, who can plan ahead, who can tell us how long our food will last and how much we need to find."

It wasn't coding. It was calculation, by hand, with pencil stubs on scraps of paper. But the underlying skills were the same—breaking down complex problems, modeling systems, finding efficiencies.

In Dharavi, Arjun found something he hadn't expected: purpose.

"You should stay," Kamala-mausi said, on his last night before he decided to try reaching his parents in Pune. "We could use minds like yours."

"I have to find my family. But I'll come back. If I can, I'll come back."

"Of course you will." She pressed a packet of dried lentils into his hands. "For the journey. And when you come back—bring others. Bring people who know things. We are going to need teachers."

Arjun left Dharavi before dawn, carrying a hand-drawn map and three liters of water in old plastic bottles. The road to Pune was 150 kilometers—an impossible distance on foot, a journey that would have taken two hours by car.

Behind him, the sun rose over Mumbai, painting the city in shades of gold and rose. Somewhere in Dharavi, Kamala-mausi was already making chai, preparing for another day of survival.

The city that had been built on dreams of modernity was learning to dream differently.
