**June 2028 — Mumbai**

Nine months after the Event, Dharavi had become a model.

Arjun stood at the entrance of what they called the Institute—really just three connected rooms in a repurposed workshop, but to the children who attended, it was a university. A place where knowledge was shared, skills were taught, futures were possible.

Kamala-mausi had been right. They needed teachers.

Arjun had returned in November, bringing with him a group of professionals from Pune—a doctor, an engineer, a chemist, a mathematician. They had nothing to offer in terms of their old specializations, but everything to offer in terms of systematic thinking, problem-solving, and the ability to learn and adapt.

The Institute taught practical skills. Water purification. Basic medicine. Food preservation. Accounting and record-keeping. Carpentry and metalworking—not just the traditional Dharavi crafts, but expanded programs that trained people from all over Mumbai.

They also taught something harder to name. Call it citizenship. Call it community. Call it the understanding that in a world without digital connections, human connections were everything.

"You have visitors," said Priya, who had followed him back to Mumbai and now managed the Institute's administration. She had found her civil service, just not the kind she had studied for.

It still surprised him sometimes—that she had come back with him. That night in Lonavala, when they had laughed together about the absurdity of their specialized knowledge, he hadn't imagined she would still be beside him six months later. But when he had set out from Pune to return to Dharavi, she had been waiting at the edge of town with her pack already shouldered.

"I told you I was good at systems," she had said. "Someone has to administrate your revolution."

Now she ran the Institute with the same quiet efficiency she brought to everything. Class schedules, resource allocation, student tracking—all managed in a series of ledgers she kept in meticulous handwriting. The children called her Priya-didi, and the adults called her the one who actually knew where things were.

She also, Arjun had learned, had no patience for sentiment when work needed doing.

"The visitors first," she said now, her voice carrying the familiar edge it got when he was moving too slowly. "Then we need to discuss the water filtration curriculum. Dr. Mehta says the current approach is too theoretical."

"He says everything is too theoretical."

"Because you keep teaching principles when people need procedures." She softened it with a small smile—the one she reserved for moments when she was telling him hard truths. "You think like a designer. They think like operators. There's a translation layer missing."

"And you're the translation layer?"

"Someone has to be."

He could have defended his approach. Instead, he found himself nodding. She was usually right about these things—about the gap between his abstractions and the practical needs of people who had never built systems, only lived inside them.

"I'll revise the module," he said. "After the visitors."

"Good." She turned to leave, then stopped. "Arjun. When did you last eat?"

He tried to remember. Morning? Yesterday evening?

She made a sound of exasperation that was somehow also affectionate. "There's roti in the back room. Kamala-mausi dropped it off an hour ago. Eat before you collapse. The Institute can't run on your idealism alone."

She left before he could respond. He stood there for a moment, aware that he was smiling, aware that he always seemed to be smiling after she walked away.

From her chai stall across the lane, Kamala-mausi was watching. When Arjun caught her eye, she raised her cup in a gesture that was somehow both innocent and entirely knowing.

"What?" he called.

"Nothing, beta. Nothing at all." But she was smiling too.

"Who?" he asked Priya, pulling his attention back to the matter at hand.

"From the municipal government. Such as it is."

Arjun walked to the front room, where two officials waited—one he recognized from the old days, a deputy commissioner who had survived the chaos, another he didn't know.

"Mr. Sharma," the commissioner said. "We've heard about what you're doing here. The municipal council—what remains of it—would like to propose something."

"Propose what?"

"We're trying to establish a coordinating body for the city. Representatives from different areas, different communities. Someone needs to think about sanitation, about food distribution, about all the systems that used to run automatically."

"You want someone from Dharavi."

"We want you, specifically. Your background—systems, optimization—it's exactly what we need. And you've proven you can adapt. Most of the people with your skills..." He didn't finish the sentence. Most of them were dead, or had fled, or were still waiting for rescue that would never come.

"I'll consult with the community," Arjun said. "Decisions here are made collectively."

The commissioner nodded. "Of course. But think about it. Mumbai needs to become a real city again. Not just a collection of survivors. That's going to require people who can see the big picture."

After they left, Arjun found Kamala-mausi at her usual spot, making chai. Her stall had become a landmark—a place where information was exchanged, deals were struck, and community was maintained one small cup at a time.

"Important visitors," she said. It wasn't a question.

"They want me to join the municipal council. To help coordinate the city."

"And what do you want?"

Arjun sat down. "I want to stay here. This is where I learned to be useful. But..."

"But the skills you learned here could help more people, if you apply them more broadly." She handed him a cup. "This is always the choice, beta. Small but deep, or wide but shallow. Both have value. Only you know which is right for you."

"What would you do?"

"I am an old woman who makes tea." She smiled. "My scope is this street, these people. But you—you have always thought in systems. In connections. Perhaps your dharma is to be a bridge between worlds."

Arjun sipped his chai. Through the window, he could see children heading to the Institute, could hear the sound of hammers from the metalworking shops, could smell bread baking in the communal ovens.

This was the new Mumbai. Not the gleaming towers and tech parks of his old life, but something older and stranger and perhaps more resilient. A city that had remembered how to survive.

"I'll do it," he said. "But I'll keep teaching here. Two days a week, at least."

"Of course you will. How else will you remember what matters?"

He finished his tea and walked toward the Institute. There was a class to teach—basic logistics, how to manage supplies, how to plan for uncertainty. The same skills that had once built digital empires, now applied to the ancient human project of keeping people alive.

Somewhere, he thought, his grandmother was laughing. He was finally making real things.
