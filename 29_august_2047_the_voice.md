**August 12, 2047 — Haven, Tennessee**

Mira Chen had never heard a voice from far away.

She had grown up with letters—paper messages carried by runners, arriving weeks or months after they were sent. She had grown up with the telegraph—click-click-click, dots and dashes, the encoded heartbeat of the Republic. She knew that somewhere out there, other people existed, living their own lives in distant settlements.

But she had never heard them.

Until today.

She sat in the radio shack—a converted storage shed behind the community hall—surrounded by salvaged vacuum tubes, hand-wound coils, and a tangle of copper wire that would have given any pre-Event engineer a heart attack.

The crystal radio receiver had taken her three years to build. The transmitter had taken another two. Both were based on designs from the 1920s, recovered from a book that Dr. Maya Chen—Mira's adopted grandmother—had found in the Indianapolis archive.

Maya was here now, sitting in the corner, watching. She was seventy-seven years old, her hair white, her hands trembling slightly. But her eyes were sharp.

"Ready?" Maya asked.

Mira adjusted the frequency dial. Static hissed from the speaker. "Ready."

She keyed the microphone. The transmitter hummed.

"This is Haven calling. Haven Community Radio. Broadcasting on... I think it's around 1.8 megahertz. If anyone can hear this, please respond."

She released the key. Static.

"Try again," Maya said.

Mira tried again. And again. For twenty minutes, nothing but static.

Then—

*"—haven? Did you say Haven? This is Nashville. Nashville Federation. We read you. Repeat, we read you!"*

Mira's heart stopped. A voice. A human voice, coming through the speaker, from sixty miles away.

"Nashville, this is Haven! We read you too!" She was laughing and crying at the same time. "Can you hear me clearly?"

*"Mostly clear! Some static. My God. We've been trying to reach you for months. Our transmitter just came online last week. This is incredible!"*

Maya stood up, leaning on her cane, and walked to the window. Outside, the sun was setting over Haven, painting the sky in shades of orange and gold.

"The silence is ending," she said softly. "Finally."

Mira kept talking. Back and forth, Haven to Nashville, voices crossing the miles without runners, without telegraphs, without waiting. Immediate. Real.

The world was reconnecting.
