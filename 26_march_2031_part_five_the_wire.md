**March 15, 2031 — Indianapolis**

The crowd had gathered at the old train station.

Elias Thorne stood on the platform, his hands black with grease, his heart hammering against his ribs. Behind him, a wooden pole stretched toward the gray March sky. From it, a single copper wire ran north—fifty miles of hand-strung cable, supported by salvaged telephone poles, crossing rivers on improvised bridges and threading through the ruins of suburbs.

At the other end, in Chicago, his apprentice Marcus Jr. was waiting.

"You're sure this will work?" Colonel Reeves asked. She was older now, her hair shot through with gray, but she had insisted on being here. The Republic's Militia General, witnessing history.

"I'm sure the physics works," Elias said. "Whether the wire holds..." He shrugged.

Jessica Mitchell stood nearby, her message runner satchel over her shoulder. She had built the communication network that connected the Republic—human runners carrying letters across hundreds of miles. Now she was watching a machine that might make her life's work obsolete.

"I'm not worried," she said, catching his eye. "People will always need people. This just makes the urgent messages faster."

Elias smiled. He liked Jessica. She understood systems.

He walked to the telegraph key—a simple device, handmade, based on diagrams from a 150-year-old textbook. A lever, a spring, a contact point. When you pressed it, it completed a circuit. Current flowed through fifty miles of wire. At the other end, an electromagnet clicked.

Dots and dashes. The language of Samuel Morse, dead for over a century, resurrected in a world without smartphones.

"Ready?" Elias asked.

The crowd had grown quiet. Two hundred people, watching a man press a button.

He pressed it.

*Click.*

He pressed again. And again. The rhythm of Morse code, learned from a book in the university library, practiced for months on short-range tests.

*H-E-L-L-O C-H-I-C-A-G-O*

Silence.

Elias held his breath. The wind rattled the wires. Somewhere in the crowd, a baby cried.

Then, from the receiver—a clicking sound. Faint, mechanical, beautiful.

*H-E-L-L-O I-N-D-I-A-N-A-P-O-L-I-S*

The crowd erupted. People were cheering, crying, hugging each other. Elias slumped against the telegraph table, suddenly exhausted.

Four years. Four years of scavenging wire, of climbing poles, of debugging connections in freezing rain. Four years of people telling him it was impossible, that the knowledge was lost, that he should focus on farming like everyone else.

He had proven them wrong.

Jessica walked up and put a hand on his shoulder. "You did it."

"We did it," Elias said. "All of us. The runners who carried the planning messages. The crews who strung the wire. The blacksmiths who made the tools." He looked at the humming wire stretching north. "This isn't about me. It's about... remembering. Remembering that we knew how to do this once. That we can know how to do it again."

General Reeves stepped forward. "Mr. Thorne, on behalf of the Midwestern Republic, I'd like to formally commission you as Director of Communications Infrastructure."

Elias blinked. "I'm an engineer, General. Not a politician."

"You're what we need you to be." She extended her hand. "Will you help us build more of these?"

He looked at the wire. At the people. At the sky.

"Yes," he said. "I will."

**April 2, 2031 — Somewhere North of Lafayette**

The line had been dead for three days.

Elias rode out with the repair crew at dawn, following the wire through fields that were just beginning to green. Spring was late this year, and the frost still clung to the shadows. The horses' breath steamed in the cold air.

Daniel, his youngest apprentice, rode beside him. Sixteen years old, with clever hands and an inexhaustible curiosity. He had been one of the first students at the Scrapyard Academy—the informal school Elias had started to teach the principles of electricity to anyone who wanted to learn.

"Could be ice damage," Daniel said hopefully. "Or a tree branch. We had three breaks last month from falling limbs."

"Could be," Elias agreed. But his gut said otherwise.

They found the break at Mile Marker 23, where the wire crossed a small creek on a jury-rigged bridge.

It wasn't ice damage.

The wire had been cut. Cleanly. Deliberately. The copper ends gleamed bright where they had been severed with shears or a blade.

And on the nearest pole, carved deep into the wood:

**THE SUN SEES**

Daniel stared at the message. "What does that mean?"

Elias said nothing. He had heard the reports from Haven—about the splinter group, about the zealot who called himself Brother Ash, about the doctrine that technology was sin and rebuilding was heresy.

He had hoped they would stay in Virginia. He had hoped they were someone else's problem.

"Fix the line," he said quietly. "I'll check the other poles."

He found two more carvings within the next mile. Same message. Same deep gouges.

**THE SUN SEES**

**May 12, 2031**

The second cut came two weeks later. This time they had climbed a pole and severed the line at the insulator, forcing the crew to rewire from scratch.

**THE SUN SEES**

**June 3, 2031**

The third cut came at night. The saboteurs had worked quickly—three poles brought down with axes, the wires tangled and ruined. A week's work destroyed in an hour.

"We can't guard fifty miles of wire," General Reeves said. Her voice was flat with frustration. "We don't have the manpower."

"Then we build redundancy," Elias said. "Parallel lines. Different routes. Make it harder to cut them all."

"That's three times the copper, Elias. Three times the labor."

"I know."

Samuel Torres, the former LAPD officer who now ran Haven's security, had traveled to Indianapolis for this meeting. He sat in the corner, arms crossed, his face unreadable.

"You know who's doing this," he said.

"We have suspicions."

"You have more than suspicions. Everyone's heard of the True Children. The gold-painted zealots who think the sun talks to them." Torres leaned forward. "This is sabotage. This is war. You let it go unanswered, you're inviting worse."

"What would you suggest?" Reeves asked.

"Find them. Arrest them. Try them. Hang them if necessary." Torres's voice was matter-of-fact. "You're rebuilding civilization here. That means laws. And laws mean consequences."

"We don't know where they are," Elias said. "They move. They hide in the mountains."

"Then hunt them."

"With what? A militia that's already stretched thin protecting farms from raiders?"

Torres shrugged. "Your choice, Director. Keep fixing wires and watching them get cut from now until whenever these lunatics get bored. Or show them that actions have costs."

Elias walked to the window. Outside, the telegraph pole stood against the evening sky, its wire humming faintly in the wind.

"There's a third option," he said.

"I'm listening."

"We show them they're wrong."

Torres snorted. "You're going to *persuade* fanatics with facts?"

"Maybe not persuade. But... I don't know. Make them see." Elias turned back. "Their whole theology is built on the idea that the sun is punishing us. That rebuilding is rebellion against divine will. But the sun isn't a god. It's a star. It doesn't *want* anything. Maya Chen has been saying this for years—the next flare is coming regardless of what we do or don't build."

"And you think if you explain that to Brother Ash, he'll say 'oh, how reasonable' and stop cutting your wires?"

"I think..." Elias stopped. "I think I have to try. Before we start killing people over telegraph poles."

Torres studied him for a long moment.

"You're a good man, Thorne. Patient. Gentle." He stood. "I hope you're still good when they escalate. Because they will. Men like Brother Ash don't *want* to be convinced. They want to be *right*. And the only way they get to be right is if people like you fail."

He walked to the door.

"Fix your wires. But post guards this time. And start thinking about what you'll do when guards aren't enough."

**December 1031 — The Scrapyard Academy, Indiana**

Daniel had grown an inch over the summer. He was seventeen now, with the beginnings of a beard that he was inordinately proud of. He had become Elias's shadow—the first one at the workshop every morning, the last to leave at night.

"I've been thinking about the saboteurs," Daniel said one evening, as they sat by the forge, waiting for a batch of insulators to cool.

"Oh?"

"They believe the sun is watching, right? That it *sees* what we do?"

"They believe it's conscious. That the CME was intentional—a judgment."

"But it wasn't. It was just... physics."

"Just physics." Elias smiled. "The most important *just* in the world."

Daniel was quiet for a moment. Then: "Do you think they'll ever stop?"

Elias looked at the forge, at the orange glow of the coals.

"I don't know, Daniel. Some people... some people need the suffering to mean something. And if you tell them it was random—that a billion people died because of charged particles and electromagnetic induction—it feels like robbery. Like you're stealing their tragedy and leaving nothing behind."

"That's stupid."

"Is it?" Elias reached for a cooling insulator, testing its surface. "When your grandmother died, did you want to know the medical cause? Or did you want to know *why*?"

Daniel didn't answer.

"We're not wired for randomness," Elias said. "We see patterns everywhere. It's what makes us good engineers. It's also what makes us vulnerable to people like Brother Ash. He's giving them a pattern. A story. Even if the story is wrong, it's *something*."

"So how do we fight that?"

"We build." Elias picked up the insulator—smooth, perfect, ready for the wire. "We keep building. We show them that the universe doesn't punish rebuilders. That the sun flares and goes quiet without any regard for human activity. And eventually..."

"Eventually what?"

"Eventually, enough people believe in the evidence. Or the fanatics get tired. Or..." He trailed off.

"Or?"

Elias thought about Torres's warning. About the escalation that might come.

"Or something forces everyone to choose," he said quietly. "And I hope we choose well."

The forge crackled in the silence.

Outside, the winter stars burned cold and indifferent.
