**August 20, 2028 — Indianapolis**

The city was quieter than the Scrapyard. In the Scrapyard, there was the sound of wind in the corrugated metal, the settling of junk, the occasional crash of something heavy falling. In the city, the silence was heavy. It was the silence of a tomb.

Elias pedaled his bike down Michigan Street, carefully navigating around the rusted husks of cars. He had a trailer hitched to the back—a wagon he'd welded together from shopping cart parts. It bumped and rattled over the pockmarked asphalt.

He wasn't here for food. The grocery stores had been picked clean months ago. He wasn't here for medicine.

He was here for the University.

The acronym—IUPUI—was still visible on the sign, though the letters were faded. He rode past the silent dormitories, past the administration buildings with their shattered windows. He stopped in front of the University Library.

The glass doors were smashed. Someone had tried to barricade them with desks, but the barricade had been breached.

Elias unholstered his pry bar—his weapon of choice—and stepped inside.

The lobby smelled of mildew and old paper. There was debris on the floor: flyers for events that never happened ("Fall Semester Kickoff: Sept 4, 2027"), student ID cards, backpacks.

He ignored it all. He walked past the dead computer terminals, those black monoliths that had once held the sum of human knowledge. They were useless now. Mirrors for his own dirty face.

He took the stairs to the third floor. Science and Engineering.

The doors here were intact. He pushed them open.

And stopped.

Rows. Rows and rows and rows of metal shelves. And on them, books. Thousands of them.

He walked down the center aisle, his heart beating faster than it had when he lit the bulb. He ran his hand along the spines. *Introduction to Thermodynamics. Fluid Mechanics. Civil Engineering Materials. Power System Analysis.*

He pulled a book from the shelf: *Electric Machinery Fundamentals*.

He opened it. Diagrams. Formulas. Text.

"It's all here," he whispered.

He had spent the last year grieving the loss of the Cloud. He had thought that when the servers died, the knowledge died with them. He had forgotten that for five thousand years, humans had written things down.

He sat on the floor, surrounded by the dust motes dancing in the shaft of sunlight from the window. He turned the pages. Here was the math for the alternator he had struggled to build. Here was the schematic for the transformer he needed. Here was the chemistry for the batteries he wanted to make.

It wasn't lost. None of it was lost. It was just... offline.

"You beautiful, heavy things," he said to the books.

He stood up and began to load his backpack. Then he went back downstairs, got his cart, and dragged it up the steps.

He filled it. *The ARRL Handbook for Radio Communications*. *The Merck Index*. *Machinery's Handbook* (the bible, he knew that much). He took books on agriculture, on medicine, on water treatment.

He worked for hours, until the cart was groaning under the weight. He was sweating, covered in dust, and thirstier than he'd ever been.

But he felt a strange sensation in his chest. It wasn't just relief. It was power.

The raiders had guns. The Republic had soldiers.

Elias had the instructions.

He pushed the cart out of the library, the wheels squeaking in the silence. The sun was setting, casting long shadows across the empty campus.

He looked back at the building. It wasn't a tomb anymore. It was a vault. And he had the key.

"One trip at a time," he said to himself. "I'll empty the whole place if I have to."

He mounted his bike and began the slow, heavy ride back to the Scrapyard. The books rattled in the trailer behind him—a sound better than any music.
