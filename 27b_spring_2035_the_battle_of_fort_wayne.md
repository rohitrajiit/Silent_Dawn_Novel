### The Battle of Fort Wayne

> *After-Action Report, Militia General Patricia Reeves. Submitted to the Republic Council, April 2035.*
>
> *"Victory in conventional terms. Defeat in human ones. We killed people who, eight years ago, were farmers and teachers and accountants. We killed them because they had nothing, and we had a little, and that gap was enough to make them our enemies. This is not a war we can win. It is a war we must render unnecessary."*

**March 2035 — Indiana-Ohio Border**

The raiders came from the east.

Colonel Patricia Reeves—Militia General Reeves, as she was now styled—watched them through salvaged binoculars from the roof of a pre-Event strip mall. Eight hundred, maybe a thousand. Horse-mounted scouts in front, then wagons, then the main body of fighters moving on foot. They had been gathering all winter in the abandoned suburbs of Toledo, and now they were moving.

"They're not a raiding party," said Captain Marcus Washington beside her. He had left Haven for this—left his fire brigade, his grandchildren, his comfortable life—because Reeves had asked, and because he still knew how to fight. "That's an invasion force."

"Yes." Reeves lowered the binoculars. "They're not coming for food. They're coming for territory. Farmland. Infrastructure. Everything we've built."

"So we stop them."

"We stop them, or we lose the Republic."

The Midwestern Republic had a standing militia of approximately three thousand fighters—farmers and craftsmen who trained one weekend a month and could be called up in emergencies. Against a determined opponent, this was not impressive. But they had advantages the raiders didn't.

They had communication. The telegraph network, built by Elias Thorne and maintained by the Communications Directorate under Jessica Mitchell, allowed Reeves to coordinate forces across hundreds of miles. She knew where the raiders were, how fast they were moving, what routes they were likely to take.

They had terrain. Fort Wayne—what remained of the pre-Event city—sat at the junction of three rivers. The bridges were gone, destroyed deliberately in the first year to prevent exactly this kind of attack. Any force coming from the east would have to cross water, and water could be defended.

And they had something the raiders didn't expect: time to prepare.

"The defensive line will be here," Reeves said, tracing her finger across the map. "The St. Joseph River. We let them cross the Maumee—there's no good place to stop them there—but we hold the St. Joseph. If they can't cross, they can't reach Indianapolis. They can't reach the farmlands. They can't reach anything that matters."

"What about the people still in Fort Wayne?"

"Evacuating now. We've had three days' warning—more than we would have had before the telegraph." Reeves looked at Marcus. "Civil defense is your specialty. Can we get everyone out?"

"Everyone who wants to go. Some won't leave. Old folks who don't want to abandon their homes. Young idiots who think they can fight." Marcus shook his head. "But yes, we can clear the defended zone. Give me until tomorrow night."

"You have until tomorrow morning. They're moving faster than we expected."

---

The battle—if it could be called that—lasted three days.

The first day was positioning. Reeves deployed her militia along the south bank of the St. Joseph, using the ruins of the old city as cover. They had crossbows, scavenged hunting rifles, a handful of working firearms with precious hoarded ammunition. Not enough for a sustained fight. Enough, maybe, for one engagement.

The raiders arrived at dusk, spreading across the north bank like a dark tide. Campfires bloomed in the ruins. The smell of cooking food drifted across the water—they were feeding their people well, which meant they had supplies. Which meant they expected a long campaign.

"They're well-organized," Captain Washington observed. "Military discipline. Scouts, sentries, supply wagons. Someone over there knows what they're doing."

"I've gotten reports," Reeves said. "Their leader is a man named Carter. Former Ohio National Guard—we were in the same unit, actually, before the Event. Good tactician. Ruthless when he needs to be."

"You know him personally?"

"I knew him. The man he is now..." She watched the enemy camp. "Survival changes people. Not always for the better."

The second day was negotiation.

A delegation crossed the river under a white flag—three men in mismatched uniforms, one of them Carter himself. Reeves met them on the southern bank, accompanied by Marcus and two armed escorts.

Carter looked older than she remembered. Thinner. His eyes had the particular emptiness of someone who had made too many hard choices.

"Patricia." His voice was careful. "It's been a long time."

"Eight years. I heard you were trying to hold Cleveland."

"Cleveland fell. Toledo fell. Everything falls eventually." He gestured at the republic's defensive line. "You've built something here. I'm impressed. But you can't hold it. Not against us."

"We can try."

"And thousands will die. On both sides." Carter stepped closer, lowering his voice. "I don't want that. I didn't come here to massacre farmers. I came because my people are starving. Because the eastern settlements failed, one by one, and the survivors have nowhere else to go."

"So you're asking us to let you in."

"I'm asking you to share. There's enough land here for everyone. Enough food, if we work together. We don't have to fight."

Reeves studied him. The earnestness seemed genuine. The desperation was definitely genuine. She could feel it radiating from him—the bone-deep exhaustion of a leader who had run out of good options.

"You brought an army to ask for charity."

"I brought protection. For my people. If we came unarmed, nothing stops you from taking what little we have left." Carter spread his hands. "This isn't what I wanted. But it's where we are. Let us settle in the northern counties. We'll pay taxes, contribute to defense, follow your laws. Just let us live."

"And if we say no?"

"Then we take what we need. Because the alternative is dying." His eyes hardened. "I've watched too many children starve, Patricia. I won't watch any more. Not if there's another choice."

Reeves was silent for a long moment. Behind her, Marcus shifted uncomfortably.

"I need to consult with the Council," she said finally. "You'll have an answer by morning."

"Make it the right answer. Please." Carter turned and walked back toward the river. "For both our sakes."

---

The Council met by telegraph that night—representatives from Indianapolis, Chicago, and a dozen smaller communities, debating the future of the Republic in dots and dashes transmitted across hundreds of miles.

The vote was close. Some argued for accommodation—let the refugees settle, expand the Republic's territory, turn potential enemies into citizens. Others argued for defense—if they gave in to one army, more would follow, and the precedent would destroy everything they'd built.

In the end, they voted for a middle path: conditional acceptance. The refugees could settle in designated areas, under Republic law, with Republic administration. But the army—the armed force that had crossed the border—would have to disarm. No private militias. No separate command structure. Loyalty to the Republic or nothing.

Reeves delivered the terms at dawn.

Carter listened, nodded slowly. "I can't accept that. My people need protection. I can't ask them to give up their weapons when—"

"Then we have nothing more to discuss."

"Patricia—"

"General Reeves. And you have one hour to withdraw across the Maumee, or we will consider your presence an act of war."

Carter's face went cold. "Then I'm sorry. I'm sorry for what happens next."

"So am I."

The third day was combat.

The raiders tried three crossings. The first was a feint—a small force making noise to draw attention while the main body moved upstream. Reeves had anticipated this; the telegraph allowed her to coordinate defenders across ten miles of riverfront.

The second crossing was serious. Two hundred fighters on makeshift rafts, covered by archers on the northern bank. They made it halfway across before the republic's rifles opened fire. The river ran red. Less than fifty reached the southern bank, and they were cut down by waiting militia before they could form a line.

The third crossing was desperate. Everything Carter had left, thrown at a single point in the hopes of breaking through. They reached the shore. They fought hand to hand in the ruins of a pre-Event shopping center. Marcus Washington, sixty-two years old, killed three men with an axe before taking an arrow in the shoulder.

When it was over, the raiders retreated. Four hundred dead, maybe more. The Republic had lost sixty-seven.

Reeves found Carter's body on the banks of the river. He had led the final charge himself—not a tactical decision, but the act of a man who had decided to die with his people rather than watch them die without him.

She stood over the body for a long moment.

"I'm sorry," she said quietly. "You were a good officer, once. A good man. This world made you something else."

Marcus approached, his arm in a sling. "General. The Council wants a report."

"Tell them we won." Reeves didn't look away from Carter's face. "Tell them we held the line. Tell them the Republic is safe."

"And the truth?"

"The truth is that we killed eight hundred people who had nothing and wanted something." She finally turned away. "The truth is that this will happen again, next year or the year after, until we find a way to make desperation unnecessary. The truth is that winning a battle doesn't mean winning the war."

She walked toward the command post, leaving Marcus to deal with the aftermath. The sun was rising over the battlefield, illuminating the bodies scattered across the ruins.

In her report to the Council, she would recommend expanded food production, refugee resettlement programs, and diplomatic outreach to struggling communities in the east. Prevention, not just defense. Building, not just fighting.

Because she had seen what happened when building stopped. She had seen it in Carter's eyes, in the faces of the dead, in the blood that stained the St. Joseph River.

Victory in conventional terms. Defeat in human ones.

She was tired of victories like this.
