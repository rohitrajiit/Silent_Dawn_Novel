**November 2027 — Indiana**

The first week home, Jessica did nothing but sleep.

Her body demanded it—thirty-one days of walking, of constant vigilance, of never knowing where the next meal would come from, had left her a hollow shell. She slept fourteen hours at a time, woke to eat whatever her mother put in front of her, then slept again. Her parents watched her with the careful attention of people tending a wounded animal, afraid to startle her back into flight.

By the eighth day, she was restless.

"I can't just sit here," she told her father. "There's too much to do."

Tom Mitchell looked up from the rain collection system he was building from salvaged gutters. "There's plenty to do right here. We need to insulate the windows. The garden needs to be put to bed for winter. The—"

"I know about the routes."

He paused. "What routes?"

"The ones forming out there." Jessica gestured vaguely toward the world beyond their street. "I traveled them. They're becoming real—trade routes, message routes. People are connecting communities, sharing information. Right now it's random, individual. But if we organized it..."

Her father studied her. She looked different, he realized. Not just thinner, though she was certainly that. There was something in her eyes—a hardness that hadn't been there before, but also a clarity. She had seen something essential during those thirty-one days, something that had forged her into a person he didn't entirely recognize.

"What are you proposing?"

By mid-November, Jessica had recruited twelve runners.

They met in the Mitchell living room, sitting in a circle around the cold fireplace—fuel too precious to waste on meetings. The group was eclectic: two teenagers from the high school cross-country team, a retired mail carrier named Doug who knew every road in Marion County, an ex-military woman named Sandra who had walked from Fort Wayne, and a handful of others who simply had good legs and better memories.

"The key is reliability," Jessica said, drawing a rough map on the back of a cereal box. "People need to know that if they give us a message, it will actually get there. Right now, everything is word of mouth—rumors, half-truths, panic. We can change that."

"How do we verify information?" Sandra asked. She had hard eyes, the eyes of someone who had already seen too much. "Anyone can claim anything."

"Multiple sources. If the same news comes from three different runners on three different routes, it's probably true. If it's just one person's story, we mark it as unconfirmed."

"What's the point?" One of the teenagers—Kyle, she thought his name was—looked skeptical. "The world's ending. Why does it matter if people in Carmel know what's happening in Fountain Square?"

Jessica thought about Chicago. About the fires that spread because no one knew where they started, the panic that killed more people than the actual chaos, the way rumors of violence had created real violence.

"Because in two months, we're all going to be hungry. Really hungry. And when people are hungry and scared and in the dark, they make terrible decisions based on bad information. If we can keep information flowing—accurate information—maybe fewer people die."

The room was quiet.

"Also," she added, "information is tradeable. Communities that want to know what's happening will give us food. Food we can share with everyone here."

That got their attention. The economics of survival were becoming brutally clear to everyone.

**Meanwhile, 600 miles southeast...**

Maya Chen limped into the valley on the morning of November 12th.

The caravan had dissolved three days earlier—some members heading toward rumored settlements in Tennessee, others giving up entirely and simply... stopping. Grace had refused to stop. "There's a place," she kept saying. "My cousin wrote about it. There's a place."

The place was a wide valley with a creek running through it, sheltered from the worst winds by surrounding hills. Maybe two dozen structures—a mix of farmhouses, a small church, what looked like a converted barn—spread across the landscape. Smoke rose from chimneys. People moved between buildings.

More importantly: they had gardens. Maya could see them even from this distance—the ordered rows, the frames for cold-weather protection, the clear signs of intentional agriculture rather than desperate foraging.

"Is this it?" she asked.

Grace was crying. Quietly, steadily, in a way that suggested she had been crying for a while and simply hadn't mentioned it. "This is it. This is Haven."

---

They were met at the edge of the settlement by a group of three—two men and a woman, all carrying tools that were obviously multi-purpose. The woman stepped forward.

"State your business."

"We're looking for refuge." Grace's voice was steadier than Maya expected. "I'm Grace. My cousin Helen wrote me about this place, before... before everything. These are survivors from the Atlanta corridor. We have skills. A doctor—" she gestured to Maya, "—or at least someone with medical training. Others who can work. We're not looking for charity. We're looking for community."

The woman studied them. Her eyes moved from face to face, assessing. Behind Maya, the remnants of the caravan stood in exhausted silence—maybe fifteen people left of the forty who had started the journey.

"How many sick?"

"Two with injuries that need attention. The rest are just... tired. Hungry."

"Any violence in your group? Any trouble?"

Grace shook her head. "We left the trouble behind us. The people who wanted to fight have either died or found other places to do it."

A long pause. The woman looked at her companions. Something passed between them—a communication refined by weeks of making these decisions.

"We have protocols. You'll be quarantined for three days—we can't risk bringing disease in. During that time, you'll be interviewed individually. If everything checks out, you can stay. But staying means working. No passengers."

"We wouldn't have it any other way," Maya said. It was the first time she'd spoken since they arrived. "I've been walking for six weeks. I didn't come all this way to sit around."

The ghost of a smile crossed the woman's face. "Let me guess. City person?"

"Atlanta. Astrophysicist." Maya laughed, a sound that surprised her. "Which is about as useful right now as a chocolate teapot."

"You'd be surprised. We've got a farmer who used to be a hedge fund manager. Turns out pattern recognition is pattern recognition." The woman extended her hand. "I'm Sarah. Welcome to Haven. Provisionally."

**And 8,000 miles away...**

Arjun Sharma woke to the sound of children singing.

It took him a moment to place it—the call-and-response of a Marathi nursery rhyme, drifting up from the lane below his borrowed room in Dharavi. For a disorienting instant, he thought he was back in his childhood, before his family moved to the tech corridors of Bangalore, before his education and career and all the choices that had led him so far from this kind of life.

He had been in Dharavi for three weeks now, and he still couldn't quite believe any of it was real.

The room was small—maybe eight feet by ten—but it was sturdy, well-ventilated, and his. Priya slept in a similar room two lanes over, part of the informal housing network that Dharavi's leaders had established for the influx of refugees from the towers. Every day, more people arrived from the failing high-rises of South Mumbai—doctors and lawyers and tech workers, stumbling into the slum with their useless skills and their desperate eyes, learning to live in a world where the infrastructure they had depended on no longer existed.

And every day, the dhobis washed clothes in the same tanks they always had. The recyclers sorted plastic with the same expert hands. The leather workers, the potters, the metalsmiths—everyone who had always done physical work with physical tools continued doing exactly what they had always done.

The electricity had been irrelevant to their survival. And that, Arjun thought, was the great joke of the apocalypse.

He rose, washed with water from the community tap—rationed now, but available—and made his way to the community center. Kamala-mausi would be there, as she was every morning, organizing the day's work allocations.

"Ah, the software engineer arrives." Her voice carried the gentle mockery that Arjun had learned was her default mode. "And what skills will you offer Dharavi today? Perhaps you can code us some vegetables? Program some clean water?"

"I thought I would help with the water purification tanks."

"You know nothing about water purification tanks."

"Then I will learn." Arjun met her eyes. "That is what I'm good at. Learning. The specific subject has never mattered much."

Kamala-mausi studied him for a long moment. Something shifted in her expression—a grudging respect, perhaps, or at least an acknowledgment that he was not entirely useless.

"There is a council meeting this afternoon. We are discussing the winter preparations—what to store, how to ration. You have experience with logistics, yes? The supply chain discussions that you tech-wallahs were always having?"

Arjun almost laughed. Supply chain optimization. Once upon a time, he had built algorithms to ensure just-in-time delivery of components across global networks. Now he would be applying the same principles to ensure that a slum of one million people didn't starve during the coming months.

"Yes," he said. "I have experience."

"Good. Then you will speak. But—" she held up a warning hand, "—you will listen first. Much more than you speak. The people who have always lived here know things that your computers never taught you. If you come in with your big-city ideas about efficiency and optimization, they will smile and nod and then ignore everything you say."

"Understood."

"Good. Now go learn about water purification. Sunil will teach you. He has only been doing it for forty years, so perhaps you can offer some 'improvements.'"

It was, Arjun realized, her way of accepting him. The mockery was real, but so was the invitation to participate. He was being given a chance to prove himself—not as the tech worker he had been, but as the community member he might become.

**November 22, 2027 — Indianapolis**

The first bad news came on a cold Tuesday.

Jessica was mapping routes on the kitchen table when Doug, the retired mail carrier, came back from his circuit to Greenwood. His face told the story before his words did.

"How bad?" she asked.

"Three warehouses burned. The National Guard depot south of the highway—someone set fire to it rather than let others have the supplies. And there's a group moving up from the south, organized, armed. They're not raiding exactly—more like demanding tribute. We give them food, they don't burn our homes."

"How far?"

"Twenty miles. Maybe three weeks at their current pace."

Jessica felt something cold settle in her stomach. She had known this was coming—had seen the signs on her walk home—but knowing and hearing were different things.

"What about the coalition in Franklin?"

"Gone. Half the people scattered, half joined the group." Doug shook his head. "When people get hungry enough, principles matter less than protection."

Later that evening, she called a meeting. Not just the runners, but representatives from every household in the neighborhood coalition—forty-three families, representing maybe a hundred and fifty people.

Her father spoke first, delivering the food inventory report. The numbers were bad but not catastrophic—if they rationed carefully, if the winter was mild, if nothing went wrong, they might make it to spring.

But nothing in this world was going to go right. That much was clear.

"We need to make decisions," Jessica said when he finished. "About defense. About rationing. About what we're willing to do to survive."

"What do you mean, 'willing to do'?" Mrs. Patterson asked.

"I mean that right now, we're sharing with everyone. Every household contributes, every household receives. But when the food runs low—really low—do we keep sharing equally? Or do we prioritize some people over others?"

The room went quiet.

"We're not monsters," someone said from the back. "We're not going to let children starve while adults eat."

"No one's suggesting that. But what about the elderly who can't work? What about the sick? What about people who join our coalition later, after they've exhausted their own supplies?"

No one wanted to answer. These were the questions that exposed the fault lines in any community—the places where principle met survival and one of them had to give.

"I'm not asking for answers tonight," Jessica continued. "I'm asking you to think about it. Because in a month, maybe two, we're going to be hungry. And hungry people don't think clearly. We need to decide now, while we can still be rational, what kind of community we want to be when things get hard."

She looked around the room—at the faces illuminated by candles and lanterns, at the people who had become her neighbors and would become either her family or her competition for survival.

"Whatever we decide, we need to commit to it together. No one will survive this alone."

---

That night, after the meeting, Jessica stepped outside to watch the stars.

The sky was more beautiful than it had ever been in her life. Without streetlights, without the orange haze of the city, the Milky Way stretched overhead like a river of light. She could see stars she had never known existed, constellations her ancestors had named but she had never properly seen.

Somewhere in Haven, hundreds of miles away, Maya Chen was probably looking at the same stars. An astrophysicist reduced to refugee, now finding meaning in the same knowledge that had become supposedly useless.

Somewhere in Mumbai, Arjun Sharma was probably asleep, or perhaps awake in the teeming lanes of Dharavi, learning to survive in a community that had never depended on the technologies he had built his life around.

And somewhere in the frozen distances to the north, winter was gathering its strength.

The stars didn't care. They had watched ice ages and extinctions and the rise and fall of civilizations. They would watch this, too—humanity's latest brush with self-destruction, the culling that would determine who inherited the future.

Jessica went back inside. There was work to do, and the cold was coming, and the people she loved were waiting for her to help them survive.

The storm was gathering. But they would face it together.
