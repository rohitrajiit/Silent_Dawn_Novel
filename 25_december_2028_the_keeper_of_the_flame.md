### The Keeper of the Flame

**December 24, 2028 — Haven, Tennessee**

The chapel was cold. The stained glass windows, salvaged from a ruined church in Knoxville and painstakingly installed in the new log structure, were dark without the streetlights outside to illuminate them.

Father Miguel struck a match.

The flame flared, small and yellow, reflecting in his eyes. He lowered it to the wick of the first candle on the altar. Then the second. Then the third.

"Light in the darkness," he whispered.

"And the darkness has not overcome it," said a voice from the doorway.

Miguel turned. Marcus Washington stood there, brushing snow from his coat. "Merry Christmas, Father."

"Merry Christmas, Marcus. Or Eve, at least."

Marcus walked down the aisle, his boots heavy on the rough-hewn floorboards. The chapel smelled of pine boughs and beeswax—scents that belonged to every Christmas Miguel had ever known, bridging the gap between the world that was and the world that is.

"Are we ready?" Marcus asked.

"As ready as we can be. The choir has been practicing. The children have their pageant." Miguel smiled. "It turns out the story of a family seeking shelter in a hostile world resonates rather strongly these days."

"I bet." Marcus sat in the front pew. "You know, I wasn't much for church before. But this... this place makes sense."

"Cathedrals were built for illiterate peasants," Miguel said, lighting a taper to carry to the nave. "They were books written in stone and glass. Now that the screens are dark, we are learning to read the physical world again. To read the sacred in the material."

He paused at the nativity scene. It was carved from local wood by a man who had been a cabinet maker in his former life. The figures were rough, simple, but deeply expressive. The baby Jesus was wrapped in a scrap of blue survival blanket.

"We have visitors," Marcus said. "A group came in from the north yesterday. They call themselves the Children of the Sun."

Miguel stiffened. "I've heard of them. Solar worshippers."

"They're not hostile. Strange, mostly. They believe the Event was a purification. That the sun is a conscious entity." Marcus looked at the crucifix on the wall. "Grace is worried they'll cause trouble. Try to convert people."

"People are hungry for meaning, Marcus. When the old stories fail, they look for new ones. Or older ones."

"What do we tell them?"

Miguel looked at the candle in his hand. "We tell them that the sun is indeed powerful. It gives life, it takes it away. It commands the seasons. But it is not a god. It is a fire. And fires must be tended."

He placed the taper in a sconce.

"We are the keepers of the flame," Miguel said. "Not the sun's flame—that burns without us. But the flame of memory. Of mercy. Of the things that make us human. If we lose that, then the sun really has won. We become just another species struggling under a heat lamp."

The bells began to ring—scavenged bells from a schoolhouse, hung in the new steeple. It was time.

The doors opened, and the people of Haven poured in. They were wrapped in wool and leather, their breath steaming in the cold air. But their faces were bright.

Maya Chen entered, holding the hand of a child. Then Grace. Then the refugees, the farmers, the mechanics, the survivors.

And among them, a few strangers. People with gold paint on their faces, looking around the chapel with wide, curious eyes.

Miguel walked to the pulpit. He didn't need a microphone. The silence of the new world carried his voice to the rafters.

"Welcome," he said. "Welcome to the darkness. And welcome to the light."

He looked at the mixed congregation—Christians, skeptics, solar worshippers, people who believed in nothing but survival.

"We are here because we survived," he said. "But survival is not enough. A heart that only beats is just a muscle. A life that only breathes is just biology. We are here to remember that we are more than biology."

He lit the Christ candle in the center of the Advent wreath.

"The world has changed," he said. "But the light has not. It shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it."

He saw Seraphina, the leader of the Children of the Sun, standing in the back. She was watching the candle, fascinated.

"Tonight," Miguel said, "we celebrate a child born in a barn. A refugee. A survivor. A symbol that even in the humblest places, God is with us."

He raised his hands.

"Let us pray. To the God of the sun, and the stars, and the dark, cold earth. Teach us to be kind. Teach us to be brave. Teach us to be the light."

"Amen," said Marcus.

"Amen," said the congregation.

"Amen," whispered Seraphina.

And as the choir began to sing "Silent Night," Miguel saw the solar worshippers joining in. They didn't know the words, maybe, or the theology. But they knew the melody. They knew the feeling of gathering together against the cold.

It wasn't a perfect unity. It was fragile, messy, human.

But it was a start.
