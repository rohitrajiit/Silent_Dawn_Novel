### The Crossing

> *Letter fragment, recovered from the Haven Archives. Dated June 2032. Original in Portuguese; translation by Fr. Miguel.*
>
> *"...when we saw your sails on the horizon, we thought we were dreaming. Five years without ships. Five years believing we were alone. Then you came, and we learned that the silence was never complete—only very, very wide."*

**July 2032 — Haven, Tennessee**

The letter had traveled for three months.

Maya Chen held it carefully, the paper soft with handling, the ink faded from salt spray and sunlight. It had crossed the Atlantic Ocean on a sailing vessel that didn't exist five years ago—a schooner built from salvaged materials by fishermen in Nova Scotia who had decided to find out if anyone else was still alive.

They had found Portugal. And Portugal had written back.

"Read it again," Grace said. She was seventy-two now, slower than she'd been but still sharp, still the heart of Haven. "I want to make sure I understand."

Maya adjusted her reading glasses—ground from salvaged lenses, a gift from the Republic's opticians—and began again.

*To whoever receives this message,*

*My name is Dr. Helena Ferreira. Before the Event, I was a marine biologist at the University of Lisbon. Now I am the unofficial chronicler of the Algarve Cooperative, a community of approximately twelve thousand people in southern Portugal.*

*When your ship arrived in our harbor last month, we did not believe what we were seeing. We had assumed the Americas were dead. The last radio contact we received—in the first weeks—was fragmentary and terrifying. Cities burning. Governments collapsing. Then silence.*

*We have our own stories of collapse. The Iberian Peninsula was... it was very bad. Lisbon burned for three weeks. Madrid was a death trap—too many people, too little water. We lost millions. Perhaps tens of millions. We don't have accurate counts. We probably never will.*

*But we survived. The coastal communities, especially. Fishing villages that never fully modernized. Small towns in the mountains where people still knew how to farm without machines. We made contact with each other slowly, by walking, by sailing small boats along the coast. We built a network. We are still building it.*

*I am writing to tell you that you are not alone. Europe is recovering. Slowly. Painfully. But recovering.*

*We have established contact with communities in France, Italy, and Morocco. The British Isles are... complicated. Ireland is doing well. England had difficulties. We don't have details.*

*We have no electricity yet, but we have libraries. We have knowledge. We have people who remember how things worked and are teaching the next generation. We are building printing presses, windmills, water-wheels. We are rebuilding.*

*Your ship's captain tells us there is a network of communities in the American southeast and midwest. He tells us there is a republic forming. He tells us people are teaching science, practicing medicine, building for the future.*

*This gives us hope. We had believed we were the last. To know that across the ocean, others are doing the same work—it changes something. It makes the work feel less lonely.*

*I am including with this letter a list of things we have learned. Techniques for desalinating water. Methods for preserving fish that last longer than salting. A simplified treatment for cholera that our doctors developed. Perhaps some of it will be useful.*

*In return, we ask only one thing: write back. Tell us your story. Tell us what you have learned. Tell us there are people on the other side of the ocean who remember that we were once connected, and who want to be connected again.*

*We are not alone. That is the message I want you to hear. Whatever happens next, we are not alone.*

*With hope,*
*Dr. Helena Ferreira*
*Algarve Cooperative*
*Portugal*

Maya set down the letter. The room was silent.

"Europe is alive," Grace said finally.

"Parts of it. She mentions losing millions, tens of millions. But yes—parts of Europe are alive." Maya touched the pages. "And they're doing the same thing we are. Building networks. Preserving knowledge. Teaching."

"The British Isles are 'complicated.'" Marcus Washington shook his head. He was in his sixties now, gray-bearded, the Fire Chief of Haven for twenty years. "That's a very diplomatic way to put what I'm guessing was a mess."

"Ireland did well. Small population, rural infrastructure, fishing traditions. They probably had similar advantages to what we saw in places like Dharavi." Maya paused. "England had more cities. More dependency on imported food. The math would have been... difficult."

Father Miguel, older still, crossed himself. "We should pray for them. All the ones we lost. All the ones we'll never know about."

"We should also write back," Grace said. She looked at Maya. "You're the one who corresponds with scientists. You're the one who's been building the solar monitoring network. You should write the response."

"Me?"

"You've been thinking about how civilizations recover for five years. You've been planning for the next Event. That's what she's asking about—what we've learned. What we're doing to make sure this doesn't happen again, or at least doesn't kill as many of us next time."

Maya looked at the letter again. At the careful handwriting, the scientific precision mixed with emotional weight. Helena Ferreira was like her—a scientist trying to make sense of collapse, trying to preserve what could be preserved.

"I'll write back," she said. "But I want to do more than that."

"What do you mean?"

"She mentions Morocco. Italy. France. If Europe is rebuilding, if they're creating networks..." Maya's mind was already racing. "We need a regular connection. Not just one ship every few years—a trade route. An information route. Shared knowledge going both ways."

"That's ambitious," Marcus said. "We barely have ships that can cross rivers."

"Nova Scotia built a schooner that crossed the Atlantic. If they can do it, we can learn. Or we can work with them." Maya stood, pacing as she always did when she was thinking. "Five years ago, we thought we were alone. That the whole world had fallen apart and we were the only ones putting it back together. Now we know there are people in Portugal doing the same thing. People in France, Italy, Morocco. Probably people in Asia, in Africa, in South America. Everywhere people survived, they're rebuilding."

"And you want to connect them all."

"I want to know them. I want to learn from them. I want to share what we've learned." She stopped pacing. "The old world was connected by electricity—instant communication, global networks. That's gone. But connection isn't gone. It's just slower. Harder. More deliberate."

"Letters across the ocean," Grace said. "Like it was two hundred years ago."

"Exactly like that. And look what humanity built in those two hundred years, even without instant communication. Revolutions. Democracies. Scientific knowledge spreading from country to country. It was slower, but it worked." Maya picked up the letter again. "This is the beginning of something. I can feel it. The moment we stopped being alone."

That night, Maya sat in her cabin and began to write.

*Dear Dr. Ferreira,*

*My name is Dr. Maya Chen. Before the Event, I was an astronomer at a research facility in Atlanta, Georgia. Now I am one of the founders of Haven, a community in Tennessee, and the coordinator of a solar observation network that spans the southeastern American states.*

*When I received your letter, I wept. I am not ashamed to admit this. For five years, I have wondered if anyone else was doing what we are doing—if the work of rebuilding was happening anywhere beyond our small corner of the world. Now I know it is. And knowing that changes everything.*

*Let me tell you what we have learned...*

She wrote for hours. About the Indianapolis Compact and the Midwestern Republic. About the solar monitoring network and the early warning systems they were developing. About Elias Thorne and his telegraph, the printing press that was starting to produce books again, the medical school that was training new doctors.

She wrote about Dharavi—about Arjun Sharma's letters, which arrived once a year via sailing ship, describing a city of ten million people learning to survive without electricity. She wrote about the teacher exchange that was beginning, students sailing between continents to learn from each other.

She wrote about Grace and the first democratic charter. About Father Miguel and the religious synthesis that was emerging. About Marcus and the fire brigades, Jessica and the postal service, all the small systems that were slowly, painfully stitching civilization back together.

And at the end, she wrote:

*You asked us to tell you our story. That is the beginning. But stories are better when they're shared. I hope this letter reaches you. I hope you write back. I hope that someday—ten years from now, fifty years from now—there are regular ships crossing the Atlantic, carrying letters and books and ideas between our communities.*

*We are not alone. You said that in your letter, and I want to say it back to you. We are not alone. And as long as we remember that, as long as we keep reaching out across the distances, we never will be.*

*With hope,*
*Dr. Maya Chen*
*Haven, Tennessee*
*The Midwestern Republic / Nashville Federation*

She sealed the letter with candle wax—electricity was still years away—and set it aside to go on the next ship heading for Nova Scotia.

Outside her window, the stars were brilliant. The same stars they were seeing in Portugal, in India, in all the scattered communities of the surviving world. 

For the first time since the Event, Maya felt truly connected. Not to the past. Not to the world that had been. But to the future. To the people around the world who were building that future, one letter and one ship and one handshake at a time.

The crossing had happened. The silence was broken.

Everything else was possible now.
