Six months after the Event—that's what people were calling it now, simply "the Event," capitalized like a proper noun—the world was still falling apart in some places and coming together in others.

Dr. Maya Chen stood on a hillside in eastern Tennessee, looking down at what she and others had built.

They called it Haven. It wasn't the only such place—communities were forming across the continent, in every pocket of stability—but it was home now. Two hundred and thirty-seven people, living in a collection of farmhouses, barn conversions, and newly constructed cabins. They had a water system (spring-fed, no electricity required). They had fields (hand-plowed, difficult but workable). They had a school (Maya taught astronomy to children who would never see satellites).

They had something like hope.

Grace was still the leader, though she insisted on calling herself a "coordinator." She had a council now—elected, more or less—that helped make decisions. Maya was on it, representing the science and medical contingent. Marcus Washington, the firefighter who had made his way down from Chicago with Mrs. Chen in tow, represented security. Father Miguel, a priest who had lost his parish but not his faith, represented something harder to name. Continuity, maybe. Connection to what had been.

"You're thinking again," said a voice behind her. 

Maya turned to find Sarah Okafor—Dr. Okafor—climbing the hill toward her. They had become friends over the hard months, bonded by the work of keeping people alive.

"Always thinking. Occupational hazard."

"You're thinking about the Event. About whether it could happen again."

Maya nodded. "The sun doesn't care about our recovery timeline. Another CME could hit tomorrow. Or next year. Or in a century. We'd be set back to zero. Less than zero, because we don't have the infrastructure anymore, don't have the knowledge base—"

"So we preserve what we can. We teach what we know. We write things down." Sarah stood beside her, looking at Haven below. "This place isn't just about survival. It's about carrying something forward."

"What if it's not enough?"

"Then it's not enough. But we try anyway." Sarah smiled. "That's what we do now. We try, even when it might not be enough. Especially then."

Maya thought about the children in her astronomy class. They would never browse the internet. Never take a commercial flight. Never know the casual, careless abundance of the world before. But they would know the real stars, unobscured by light pollution. They would know where food came from. They would know their neighbors—actually know them, not just recognize their faces.

Was that better? Worse? Different?

Different. It was certainly different.

"We're documenting everything," Maya said. "The Event. What we lost. What we learned. Future generations should know."

"Writing by hand?"

"One of the teachers found an old printing press in an antique shop. We're restoring it. Limited production, but better than nothing." Maya paused. "I've been working on something. A manual. How to prepare for the next one. Technical details, practical steps. If the sun does this again in a hundred years, in five hundred years—I want our descendants to be ready."

Sarah nodded. "That's very you. Planning for disasters centuries away."

"Someone has to."

They stood together in comfortable silence, watching the sun set over Haven. The sun that had destroyed their world. The sun that also kept them alive. The great indifferent engine of the solar system, which knew nothing of cities or computers or human plans.

The stars emerged as darkness fell. The Milky Way stretched across the sky, brilliant and ancient and utterly unconcerned with the tiny creatures below.

Maya felt small. Everyone felt small these days—small and humble and aware of their own fragility in a way that modern civilization had allowed them to forget.

But small didn't mean powerless. Small didn't mean hopeless.

"Come on," Sarah said. "Dinner's soon. Mrs. Chen is making soup."

"Of course she is."

They walked down the hill together, toward the lights of Haven—candles and oil lamps and the occasional fire—toward the community that had somehow coalesced from disaster.

Behind them, the stars wheeled in their eternal patterns, indifferent to the end of one world and the beginning of another.
