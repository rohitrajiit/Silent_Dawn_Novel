> *"First, do no harm. Second, do what you can. Third, teach others." — Dr. Sarah Okonkwo*

**September 2033 — Haven, Tennessee**

The lecture hall had once been a barn.

Dr. Sarah Okonkwo stood at the front, a handwritten diagram of the human circulatory system pinned to the wall behind her. Thirty students sat on rough benches, notebooks open, pencils ready. The youngest was fourteen. The oldest was sixty-two.

"The heart," Sarah said, pointing to the diagram, "is a pump. Four chambers. Two circuits—pulmonary and systemic. Blood goes out, blood comes back. It's not magic. It's plumbing."

A few nervous laughs. Medical education in the new world required a certain amount of demystification.

Sarah was twenty-eight years old. She had been twelve when the Event happened—old enough to remember the old world, young enough to have grown up in the new one. Her father, Dr. David Okonkwo, had been a surgeon in Atlanta. He had died in the third year, trying to perform an appendectomy with kitchen knives and moonshine for anesthesia.

He had saved the patient. The infection had taken him two weeks later.

Sarah had inherited his medical textbooks—physical copies, miraculously preserved. She had spent her teenage years studying them by candlelight, practicing sutures on pig carcasses, learning the names of bones and the pathways of nerves.

Now she was teaching others.

"The disease we're going to discuss today is cholera," she continued. "It's a bacterial infection of the small intestine. Symptoms: severe diarrhea, dehydration, death within hours if untreated. Treatment: rehydration. That's it. Give the patient enough clean water with salt and sugar, and most will survive."

She wrote on the rough chalkboard: *ORS — Oral Rehydration Solution. 1 liter clean water. 6 teaspoons sugar. 1/2 teaspoon salt.*

"This formula has saved more lives than any surgery ever invented. It costs nothing. It requires no special equipment. And yet, in the first year after the Event, thousands of people died of cholera because no one remembered it."

The students wrote furiously.

"Medicine," Sarah said, "is not about technology. It's about knowledge. And knowledge, unlike technology, cannot be destroyed by a solar storm. It can be forgotten. It can be lost. But as long as one person remembers, it can be taught again."

She looked at her students. Future doctors, nurses, midwives, herbalists. They would fan out across the region, carrying what they learned here to communities that had never had access to formal medical care.

"Your assignment for next week: memorize the symptoms of the ten most common bacterial infections and their treatments. We will have a practical examination. Dismissed."

The students filed out. Sarah stood alone in the barn, looking at her father's medical textbook on the podium. The pages were yellowed, the binding cracked. She had read it so many times she could recite passages from memory.

*First, do no harm.*

"I'm trying, Papa," she whispered. "I'm trying."
