Jessica Mitchell had been awake for four hours, and she had already seen three fistfights.

The first was at the convenience store on her block, where two men had fought over the last case of bottled water until one lay bleeding on the linoleum and the other limped away with his prize. The second was at the apartment complex next door, where a woman had tried to siphon gas from a car—not that it would help, but people hadn't figured that out yet—and the owner had caught her. The third was political, of a sort: two neighbors arguing about whether this was a terrorist attack, a foreign military strike, or the rapture.

Jessica sat on her fire escape, four stories above the street, and watched the city she loved begin to eat itself.

She was twenty-eight years old, single, a project manager at a tech startup that no longer existed in any meaningful sense. Her apartment was a carefully curated space—mid-century modern furniture, succulents in geometric planters, smart speakers in every room. Every convenience of modern urban life.

None of it mattered now.

Her phone was dead. Her laptop was dead. The electric stovetop wouldn't light. The refrigerator was already warming, the ice cream pooling in its container. She had a case of LaCroix, half a jar of peanut butter, some crackers, and an emergency bottle of wine she'd been saving for a particularly bad day.

This qualified.

Through the fire escape's wrought iron, she could see the evidence of annihilation. A commercial airliner had come down somewhere to the west—she had seen the smoke plume at dawn, heard the distant thunder of impact that had shaken her windows. Along Lake Shore Drive, cars sat frozen in place like toys abandoned by a giant child, some with doors hanging open where drivers had fled, others with crumpled hoods where they had rear-ended the vehicles ahead when every engine had stopped simultaneously.

The city's transformers had exploded during the night. She had heard them—deep, resonant booms that rolled across the city like distant artillery. From her window, she could see one now: a blackened metal skeleton surrounded by char, its oil still burning sluggishly, sending greasy smoke into the morning air. There were dozens more like it across Chicago. Hundreds across Illinois. Thousands across the world. Every transformer that connected power plants to the grid had become a bomb when the geomagnetic currents flooded through them.

And even if you rebuilt the transformers—a process that took months for a single unit, that required factories and supply chains and trucks and computers, all of which no longer existed—there was nothing to connect them to. The power plants themselves were dead. Nuclear reactors had scrammed automatically, their digital control systems fried, their cooling pumps frozen. Coal plants had shut down when their computerized systems failed. Natural gas turbines, hydroelectric generators, solar farms with their smart inverters—all dead. The entire electrical infrastructure of human civilization, built over a hundred and fifty years, had been erased in a single night.

She picked up her phone again. The fourth time in ten minutes. The screen remained dark, but her thumb still swiped across it, a reflex deeper than thought. She felt a phantom vibration against her thigh—the ghost of a notification that would never come. Her brain, trained by ten thousand dopamine hits, kept reaching for a fix that no longer existed.

She set the phone down. Picked it up again. Put it in the drawer. Took it out.

"Stop," she said out loud. Her voice sounded strange in the silent apartment. When was the last time she'd been in true silence? No background music. No podcast. No Netflix. No hum of appliances. Just... nothing.

The nothing was unbearable.

She tried to read a book—an actual paper book, a novel she'd bought years ago and never opened. The words swam. Her eyes kept drifting to the corner of the page, looking for hyperlinks that weren't there. After three paragraphs, she realized she hadn't absorbed a single sentence. Her brain kept waiting for the dopamine hit of a new notification, a new like, a new message.

Nothing came.

She stood up. Sat down. Stood up again. Walked to the window. Walked back. Her hands didn't know what to do with themselves. For as long as she could remember, her hands had always held something—a phone, a laptop, a tablet. Now they hung at her sides, useless appendages, fingers twitching with the memory of scrolling.

She found herself sitting in front of her laptop, staring at the blank screen. She knew it was dead. She had confirmed this a dozen times. But she sat there anyway, frozen, because she didn't know what else to do. The screen had always told her what to do next. The screen had always filled the silence. The screen had always provided the next task, the next distraction, the next tiny hit of engagement.

Without it, she was just... a person. Sitting in a room. With nothing but her own thoughts.

The thoughts were not pleasant company.

How many hours had she spent, really spent, in her own unmediated mind? Not listening to a podcast. Not scrolling social media. Not watching something in the background while doing something else. When was the last time she had been truly, completely present in a moment without digital augmentation?

She couldn't remember. Maybe childhood. Maybe never.

Her leg bounced. Her jaw clenched. Somewhere deep in her brain, addiction circuits fired uselessly, demanding stimulation that would never arrive. This, she realized, was withdrawal. Real withdrawal. The same as any drug. Her generation had been the test subjects for an unprecedented experiment in human neurochemistry, and the experiment had just been terminated without warning.

She thought about her parents in Indianapolis. Two hours by car. Maybe five or six days on foot, if she pushed hard, if nothing went wrong. If the roads were safe. If she could find food and water. If, if, if.

The smart decision was probably to stay put. Wait for authorities. Wait for help.

But she'd worked in tech long enough to know that "wait for the system to fix itself" was a sucker's game. Systems failed. Backups failed. Single points of failure brought down everything.

And this—whatever this was—seemed like the mother of all single points of failure.

A scream rose from somewhere in the building. Then voices. Then running footsteps.

Jessica retreated inside her apartment and locked the door. Then she pushed her bookshelf in front of it, the one with her collection of modern literature and the framed photo of her family at Michael's wedding last year.

She looked at the photo. Mom and Dad. Michael and his wife Sarah (not to be confused with Mom). Emily with her girlfriend Patricia. Everyone smiling, everyone connected by invisible threads of love and obligation and shared history.

She had never felt more alone.
