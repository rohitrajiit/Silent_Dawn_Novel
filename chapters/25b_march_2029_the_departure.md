### The Departure

**March 2029 — Haven, Tennessee**

The vote was thirty-four to thirty-three.

Garrett Hollis sat perfectly still as the count was read aloud. One vote. One vote had decided the future of the Republic. His future.

"The motion for an Emergency Chancellor provision fails," Colonel Reeves announced. Her voice was steady, professional. "We will proceed with the distributed response protocols proposed by Ms. Mitchell."

One vote.

Garrett replayed the final moments in his mind. When the count had reached thirty-three to thirty-three, every eye in the gymnasium had turned to Grace. She had sat in the back, quiet throughout the debate, her expression unreadable. She hadn't spoken. She hadn't needed to.

"I vote against," she had said. Just three words, soft enough that people in the front rows had to lean forward to hear.

One vote. From a woman who owed him twenty-four hundred pounds of grain.

The irony, Garrett thought as he walked back to his quarters that evening, was that he wasn't even wrong. Everyone in that gymnasium knew he wasn't wrong. The Republic had nearly fallen apart during the Lafayette raid because the Council couldn't convene quickly enough. Three communities had been overrun in the east while the Assembly debated response protocols. Fourteen people had starved at Terre Haute while their leaders held votes about rationing.

He had the data. He had always had the data.

But data didn't matter when people were voting with their hearts instead of their heads. Grace had made her choice, and two hundred people would follow her into whatever beautiful disaster democratic governance produced. Because it felt better. Because it made them feel virtuous.

*I could have saved them*, he thought. *I would have saved them.*

Two weeks later, when the first families came to him quietly, asking if there was another way, he realized he still could.

The recruitment happened in the margins. Late-night conversations. Careful questions asked to people he'd identified as dissatisfied—the engineers frustrated by endless committee approvals, the doctors who had watched patients die while the Council debated medicine allocation, the administrators who understood that efficiency wasn't cruelty, it was survival.

"What exactly are you proposing?" asked Rebecca Marsh, who had followed him from Ohio and grown increasingly frustrated with Haven's governance.

"A new community. One built on principles that actually work." Garrett spread a map across his table. "There's a former corporate campus in eastern Ohio—Meridian Technologies. Pre-Event, it was a research facility. Solar panels, water treatment, defensible perimeter. Administration buildings that could house five hundred people."

"You want to start over."

"I want to do what we did in Ohio, but bigger. Better. Without a Council second-guessing every decision." He looked at her. "I'm not rebelling against the Republic. I'll sign their Compact, follow their laws, contribute to mutual defense. But within our walls, we do things our way."

"How many people?"

"Two hundred to start. Skilled workers—engineers, doctors, farmers who understand modern agriculture. People who want to build something that works instead of something that feels good."

Rebecca studied the map. "And governance?"

"Simple. Clear hierarchy. Defined roles. Decisions made by competent authority, not popular vote." Garrett sat back. "Workers contribute according to their abilities and receive according to their output. Everyone knows what's expected. No debates about fairness—the metrics handle that."

"Some would call that a corporation, not a community."

"Corporations built the world we lost. They were efficient, productive, capable of coordinated action on massive scales. Democracy is good at legitimacy. It's terrible at execution." He met her eyes. "Which matters more when people are dying?"

The departure was announced at the April Assembly. Garrett rose during open comments and delivered a speech he had written and rewritten a dozen times.

"I am not leaving in anger," he said, facing the representatives of forty communities. "I am leaving because this body has chosen a path I cannot support. You have chosen deliberation over action. Consensus over competence. These are defensible choices—but they are choices with consequences.

"My people—two hundred skilled workers who share my concerns—will be founding a new settlement within Republic territory. We call it Meridian. We will honor the Compact. We will contribute to mutual defense. We will trade fairly with any community that trades fairly with us.

"But we will govern ourselves according to principles we believe will produce better outcomes. In ten years, twenty years, fifty years—history will judge which approach was wiser."

He paused, looking around the gymnasium.

"I hope, sincerely, that you prove me wrong. I hope your democracy flourishes. I hope your children thrive. But if they don't—if you face a crisis you cannot vote your way out of—Meridian will be here. Organized. Productive. Ready to help."

He sat down to silence. Not hostile silence—confused silence. He wasn't raising an army. He wasn't threatening secession. He was simply... leaving.

Colonel Reeves handled it with characteristic professionalism. "The Compact permits any community to govern itself as it sees fit within its territory. Mr. Hollis's settlement, if it honores Article Four, remains a member in good standing."

Grace caught his eye across the gymnasium. Her expression was unreadable.

They left in May, when the roads were clear and the weather was warm. Two hundred people, twelve wagons, their skills packed in their heads and their hopes packed in their hearts.

The Meridian campus was exactly as Garrett had described—defensible, equipped, ready for habitation with minimal work. Within a month, they had the solar panels running. Within three, the water treatment was operational. Within a year, they had the most productive agricultural output per capita of any settlement in the Republic.

"We're proving something here," Garrett told his people at the first anniversary gathering. "We're proving that efficiency isn't the enemy of humanity—it's the expression of it. Every life we save through better organization is a vote for our approach. Every child who grows up healthy because we allocated resources intelligently is an argument for what we've built."

The applause was genuine, if measured. These weren't people who wasted energy on excessive celebration.

"The old world failed because it forgot how to execute," he continued. "It debated endlessly while problems mounted. It voted itself into paralysis. We won't make that mistake. We will act. We will build. And when the history of this recovery is written, Meridian will be remembered as the community that understood what survival actually requires."

He believed every word. That was the thing about Garrett Hollis—he always believed. Not in himself, not in power for its own sake, but in the cold, clear mathematics of efficiency. He had seen the data. He knew what worked.

What he didn't see—couldn't see, perhaps—was that systems designed for survival often failed at living. That children raised on productivity metrics would eventually ask questions that metrics couldn't answer. That efficiency, taken to its logical conclusion, left no room for the inefficient, beautiful, essential things that made human communities worth saving in the first place.

But that was a lesson for the future.

For now, Meridian grew. And Haven watched. And the argument about how best to survive the aftermath continued, one community at a time, one choice at a time, into a future neither side could fully imagine.
