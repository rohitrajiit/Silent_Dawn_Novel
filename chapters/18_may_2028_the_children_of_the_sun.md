### The Children of the Sun

**May 2028 — Blue Ridge Mountains, Virginia**

The caravan had stopped at the edge of the valley, and for the first time in weeks, it wasn't because of a broken axle or a washed-out bridge.

They had stopped because of the music.

"Drums," Marcus Washington said, standing on the hood of the lead truck—a diesel relic converted to run on biofuel. "And... chanting?"

Maya Chen stepped out of the passenger seat, shielding her eyes against the late afternoon sun. "Singing. It sounds like a hymn."

It did sound like a hymn, but the melody was wrong. Too dissonant. Too rhythmic. It pulsed through the humid air, bouncing off the granite cliffs, a heartbeat that seemed to synchronize with their own.

"We go around," Marcus decided. "Whatever that is, we don't need it."

"We need water," Maya pointed out. "The map says there's a spring-fed reservoir in that valley. The last reliable source for forty miles."

They argued for ten minutes, but thirst won. They descended into the valley slowly, weapons ready—shotguns, hunting rifles, a few pistols. The caravan from Haven was peaceful, but they weren't naive.

What they found wasn't a raider camp.

It was a congregation.

---

There were perhaps a hundred of them, gathered in a natural amphitheater at the base of the cliffs. They were dressed in white—sheets, tablecloths, bleached clothes—and their faces were painted with gold patterns that caught the dying light.

In the center, a woman stood on a rock. She was young, barely twenty, with eyes that seemed too large for her face. She was staring directly at the sun, unblinking.

"Behold!" she cried, her voice echoing across the valley. "The Eye closes for the night, but its judgment remains! It sees us! It knows us! It burns away the false and leaves only the true!"

"Burn away the false!" the congregation chanted back. "Leave only the true!"

Maya watched from the cover of the treeline. "Solar worship," she whispered. "I've heard rumors, but..."

"It makes sense," Marcus murmured. "The sun destroyed the world. Why wouldn't people start worshipping it? Fear and awe are the roots of all religion."

"This isn't just religion. Look at them."

They looked... happy. Ecstatic, even. In a world of starvation and fear, these people were radiating a terrifying joy. They danced as the sun dipped below the horizon, raising their hands as if to catch the last photons.

"Travelers!"

The voice startled them. The young woman on the rock was pointing directly at their hiding spot. She hadn't looked away from the sun, but she had known they were there.

"Come out of the shadows! The Children of the Sun welcome all who carry the light!"

They stayed for dinner because refusing seemed dangerous, and because the smell of roasting meat was overwhelming.

The community—if you could call it that—lived in a collection of yurts and tents arranged in a perfect circle. In the center was a massive sundial constructed from stones and scavenged metal.

"We were lost," explained a man named Elias, who seemed to be the group's elder, though the young woman, Seraphina, was clearly the leader. "Before the Event, we were lost in the darkness of the machine. The screens. The networks. The false lights that blinded us to the true light."

He tore a piece of roasted venison and handed it to Maya.

"Then the Sun spoke. It screamed, really. A scream of pure energy that silenced the false lights. It stripped us naked so we could be clothed in truth."

"It killed a billion people," Marcus said flatly. "It destroyed civilization. It wasn't a revelation, it was a disaster."

"Was it?" Seraphina appeared beside them. Up close, her eyes were disturbing—the pupils dilated, the irises flecked with gold paint. "Civilization was killing us, Marcus. Slowly. Spiritually. The Sun saved us. It broke the chains of the digital devil and set us free."

"By freezing us in the dark?"

"The darkness is the test. The cold is the winnowing. Those who cannot hold the light within themselves will perish. Those who can..." She smiled, and it was the most beautiful, terrifying smile Maya had ever seen. "We will build the Golden Age."

Maya looked around the circle. She saw former accountants, mechanics, teachers. She saw people trauma-bonded by catastrophe, desperate for meaning, desperate for a narrative that made their suffering purposeful.

"You believe the Event was intentional," Maya said. "A punishment."

"Not punishment. Surgery. To save the patient, you must cut out the cancer." Seraphina touched Maya's arm. Her hand was fever-hot. "You are a scientist. You served the machine. But you see it now, don't you? The purity of this world? The silence?"

"I see the stars," Maya said carefully. "I see the physics of a coronal mass ejection. I see probability."

"And that is why you are still afraid. You think this was an accident. Random chance. Meaningless." Seraphina leaned closer. "How can you bear the weight of all this death if it means nothing?"

The question hung in the air, heavy as the humidity.

Maya thought about the children in Haven. About the graves they had dug. About the empty cities and the silent highways.

"I bear it because I have to," she said. "We create our own meaning. We don't need the sun to give it to us."

Seraphina laughed—a sound like breaking glass. "Brave. Foolish. But brave. You will stay the night. You will see the sunrise. And then you will decide if it is just physics."

They left at dawn.

The ceremony began before the sun appeared. The drumming started in the dark, building a rhythmic trance that vibrated in the chest. As the first rays crested the mountains, the chanting began—a guttural, rising sound that felt ancient and new at the same time.

Seraphina stood on her rock, arms wide, screaming her welcome to the star.

"It's seductive," Marcus admitted as they drove away, back onto the broken highway. "The certainty of it. Knowing exactly why everything happened."

"That's why it's dangerous," Maya said. She looked back at the valley, now bathed in morning light. "When you believe God destroyed the world to save it, you can justify almost anything to help Him finish the job."

"You think they're dangerous?"

"I think they're expanding. Did you see the map in Elias's tent? They have 'temples' marked in three states. They're sending missionaries."

"Missionaries for the sun." Marcus shook his head. "Just what we needed."

Maya watched the road ahead. The world was filling up with new things—new governments, new economies, new gods. The vacuum left by the collapse was being filled, and not all of it by reason and democracy.

The Great Filter hadn't just tested their bodies. It was testing their minds. Their souls.

"We need to warn Haven," she said. "Ideas spread faster than viruses. And this one... this one has a very high fever."
