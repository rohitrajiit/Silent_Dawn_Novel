**November 2027 — Indiana**

Jessica Mitchell rolled up to her parents' house on a bicycle that had seen better days, carrying supplies that had been given by strangers, wearing clothes that were no longer really clean.

She had been traveling for thirty-one days.

The house looked different. Older somehow, though it couldn't have aged that much in a month. Then she realized: it was the context. Without the cars in the neighbors' driveways, without the streetlights, without the constant background hum of modern life, the house looked like it belonged to another century.

Which, she supposed, it now did.

Someone was working in the front garden—her mother's garden, the one Sarah Mitchell had tended for decades. The figure straightened as Jessica approached.

"Mom?"

Sarah Mitchell stared. Her face went through a sequence of emotions—disbelief, hope, terror that hope might be wrong—before settling on something close to joy.

"Jessica? JESSICA!"

Then they were holding each other, and Sarah was crying, and Jessica was crying, and none of the last thirty-one days seemed to matter anymore.

"We thought—" Sarah couldn't finish the sentence. "Chicago was burning. We heard—someone said—"

"I walked. Mostly. Then I had a bike. Then I walked again when the bike broke. Then another bike." Jessica laughed, a sound that surprised her. She hadn't laughed in weeks. "It's a long story."

"Your father. TOM! TOM, COME HERE!"

Tom Mitchell emerged from the house at a run. He was thinner than Jessica remembered, and there was gray in his hair that hadn't been there before. But his arms were strong when they wrapped around her.

"My girl," he said. "My baby girl."

They sat on the porch for hours, exchanging stories. Tom and Sarah had fared relatively well—their suburban neighborhood had organized quickly, sharing resources, setting up a water collection system from the creek behind the development, establishing watch schedules. The old skills had come back. Canning. Gardening. Mending. The skills that the previous generations had kept alive, that had seemed like quaint hobbies before.

"What about Michael? Emily?" Jessica asked.

Her parents' faces told the story before their words did. "We don't know. We've had no contact with anyone more than walking distance away. There's talk of message runners, people who carry news between communities, but..."

"I might be able to help with that," Jessica said. "On my way here, I learned things. Met people. There are routes forming. Trade routes, communication routes. It's primitive, but it's growing."

Her father looked at her with an expression she didn't recognize at first. Then she understood: it was respect. Not the automatic respect of parent for child, but the earned respect of one adult for another who had proven themselves capable.

"You made it here alone," he said. "Three hundred miles, through... everything. I couldn't have done that."

"You could have. You would have." Jessica took his hand. "I learned from you. Both of you. Everything I needed to survive—you taught me. I just didn't know it until I needed it."

That night, for the first time in a month, Jessica slept in a real bed. She dreamed of roads and strangers and stars, and woke up uncertain whether any of it had been real.

Then she looked out the window at a world without electricity, without cars, without the trappings of the 21st century, and remembered.

It was all real. It was all still happening. And she had survived.
