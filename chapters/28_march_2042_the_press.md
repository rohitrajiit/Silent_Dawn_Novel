**March 2042 — Indianapolis**

The machine was beautiful.

Jessica Mitchell stood beside it, running her hand along the wooden frame. A printing press—built from salvaged metal, hand-carved type, and fifteen years of stubborn effort.

"It's ready?" she asked.

Elias Thorne nodded. He was forty-three now, his hair graying at the temples, his hands permanently stained with ink and oil. "Ready as it'll ever be."

The manuscript lay on the table beside them. *Electricity from First Principles*—everything Elias had learned about generating, transmitting, and using electrical power, written in clear language that didn't require an engineering degree to understand.

For fifteen years, he had distributed this knowledge through hand-copied manuscripts. Scribes in Indianapolis, Chicago, Cincinnati had laboriously reproduced the text, creating perhaps a hundred copies. Not enough. Never enough.

Now they could make five hundred. Then five thousand. Then more.

"You realize what this means," Jessica said. "Once we can print books..."

"Everything changes," Elias finished. "Medical textbooks. Agricultural manuals. History. Literature. We're not just surviving anymore. We're preserving."

He pulled the lever. The press descended with a satisfying thunk. Paper met type. Pressure was applied.

He lifted the lever. Pulled out the sheet.

The first page of *Electricity from First Principles*. Crisp, clean, identical to every other copy that would follow.

"Page one," Elias said. "Only three hundred and twelve to go."

Jessica laughed. "Should take you... what, a month?"

"Two weeks, if the crew works in shifts." He looked at the printed page. "My father used to say that the internet was humanity's greatest achievement. All the world's knowledge, accessible anywhere." He shook his head. "He was wrong. This is the achievement. Putting knowledge on paper. Making it permanent. Making it unkillable."

"The internet was convenient," Jessica said.

"Convenient isn't the same as durable." Elias set the page aside and loaded another sheet. "Books survived the burning of the Library of Alexandria. They survived the fall of Rome. They survived the Event. They'll survive whatever comes next."

He pulled the lever again.

*Thunk.*

Another page. Another copy. Another piece of the future, locked into permanence.
