**October 2027 — Maharashtra**

Arjun had been walking for eight days.

The old Mumbai-Pune Expressway, once a showcase of Indian infrastructure, was a graveyard of dead vehicles. BMWs and autorickshaws, Audis and BEST buses—all equal now, all equally useless. He walked along the service road for the most part, avoiding the main corridors where groups of travelers sometimes clashed over resources.

The Ghats were beautiful. He had driven through them dozens of times, never really seeing them, always focused on the destination. Now, on foot, he saw everything. The waterfalls cascading down volcanic rock. The mist that settled in the valleys at dawn. The monkeys that watched from the trees, curious about the strange humans invading their territory.

He also saw the bodies. Not many, but enough. Heart attacks, mostly—elderly travelers who had set out on foot, not understanding how difficult the journey would be. A few looked like violence. He didn't investigate.

On Day Five of the walk, he fell in with a group. Twelve people, led by a retired Army jawan named Sunil, who had organized them into a walking battalion.

"Pune?" Sunil asked, when Arjun explained his destination.

"My parents. I'm hoping..."

"Everyone is hoping. That's all we have left." Sunil handed him a portion of curd rice wrapped in banana leaves. "Eat. We share everything. That's the rule."

The group included a doctor—an ophthalmologist, not particularly useful in the current crisis, but trained in basic medicine. A teacher. Three families with children. An old couple who moved slowly but refused to be left behind. And a young woman named Priya, who had been studying for her civil services exam when the world ended.

She was quiet during the day's walking, efficient in her movements, always helping with the children when they grew tired. Arjun noticed her watching him sometimes—curious, appraising. He couldn't tell if she found him lacking or interesting.

On the fifth night, they made camp in an abandoned resort hotel in Lonavala. The monsoon season was approaching, and the air was thick with the memory of rain. The group had secured the ground floor, blocking the entrances, setting watch schedules. Most collapsed immediately into exhausted sleep.

Arjun couldn't sleep. He climbed to the rooftop terrace and found Priya already there, sitting on the edge of a dry fountain, looking at the stars.

"I was preparing for UPSC prelims," she said without turning around, as if continuing a conversation they'd already started. "Indian polity. Economics. Current affairs." She laughed, and there was something broken in the sound. "What current affairs? There is no current anymore. Only history repeating itself."

"What will you do now?"

"What everyone does. Survive. Help others survive." She finally looked at him. Her face was sharp in the starlight—strong jaw, dark eyes that held something he couldn't name. "Maybe this is what I was studying for anyway. Administration. Organization. Someone has to keep people together."

Arjun sat a few feet away from her, close enough to talk quietly but far enough to maintain the careful distance that exhausted strangers kept with each other. "Where were you when it happened?"

"Nagpur. My flat in Sitabuldi." Her voice was flat. "I was reviewing constitutional amendments when the power went out. I thought it was just load shedding. I went to my window to complain to my neighbor, and I saw the sky was on fire."

"Your family?"

The silence lasted long enough that Arjun wished he hadn't asked.

"My parents are in Chandigarh," she said finally. "My sister in Jaipur. My brother—" She stopped. "My brother was in the Army. Posted in Arunachal. I don't know if there's an Army anymore. I don't know if there's a Chandigarh or a Jaipur." She pulled her knees to her chest, making herself smaller. "I walked for two weeks. I saw enough to know that I can't get to them. Even if they're alive—and I have to believe they're alive—it would take months. Months of walking through..." She gestured at the darkness beyond the terrace. The unknown.

"I'm sorry."

"Why? You didn't make the sun angry." She smiled, but it didn't reach her eyes. "What about you? Why are you walking to Pune?"

"My parents. My father is a retired bank manager. My mother—" He thought of her face, the way she worried, the way she always sent him home with too much food. "She's probably organized the whole neighborhood by now. She's practical like that."

"You sound like you're trying to convince yourself."

The observation cut closer than it should have. Arjun looked away. "I left people behind in Mumbai. People who needed help. I was in Dharavi when the Event happened—this... it's a slum, but it's more than that. A whole ecosystem. Two million people who knew how to survive without the systems the rest of us depended on."

"So why did you leave?"

"Because I thought my parents needed me more. Because I was scared. Because—" He stopped. He hadn't admitted this to anyone. "Because I didn't know how to stay. I didn't know how to be useful. All my skills were worthless. Software architecture. Digital systems. I couldn't even boil water properly the first week."

"And now you feel guilty."

"Don't you? You left your family too."

"I didn't leave. I couldn't reach them." But her voice wavered. "There's a difference."

"Is there?"

They sat with that for a while. The stars wheeled overhead, impossibly bright without city lights. Somewhere in the valley below, a dog howled—stray, or abandoned.

"I keep thinking about the exam," Priya said suddenly. "The UPSC. How I spent three years preparing. Ethics papers. Governance essays. All those case studies about disaster management, about leadership during crisis." She laughed again, and this time there was genuine absurdity in it. "I memorized the National Disaster Management Act of 2005. I could recite its provisions in my sleep. And now here I am, actually living through a national disaster, and none of that knowledge matters at all."

Arjun found himself smiling despite everything. "I spent five years building redundant systems. Failsafes for failsafes. The whole point was to make sure that if one thing went wrong, everything else could keep running."

"And?"

"The sun took out everything. All of it. Every failsafe failed simultaneously. The most redundant systems in history, and none of them thought to account for the power source disappearing." He shook his head. "Years of work. Hundreds of crores of investment. And now I'm walking through the Ghats like my great-grandfather did, carrying water in a plastic bottle."

Priya's laugh this time was different—surprised, almost warm. "We're absurd," she said. "All of us. The whole species. We built these incredible systems and forgot that we were standing on a ball of rock next to an uncontrollable fusion reactor."

"To be fair, the fusion reactor had been behaving itself for quite a while."

"Famous last words."

They laughed together then, really laughed—the kind of laughter that exists only when everything is so broken that nothing is sacred anymore. The kind that acknowledges despair by refusing to bow to it.

When the laughter faded, the silence between them was different. Warmer.

"I think I might go back," Arjun said. "To Dharavi. After I see my parents. There was this old woman—Kamala-mausi—she said they needed teachers. People who could think in systems."

"Systems," Priya repeated thoughtfully. "That's what governance is, really. Systems for making collective decisions. For allocating resources. For keeping people together." She looked at him directly for the first time without evaluation—just recognition. "Maybe that's what we're both good at. Building systems. Just not the kind we originally planned."

"Maybe."

She stood, brushing dust from her kurta. "I should try to sleep. Tomorrow is another twenty kilometers."

"Priya." She stopped. He didn't know why he'd called her name—didn't have anything specific to say. "I'm glad we're walking in the same direction."

She smiled. In the starlight, it transformed her face—not softer, exactly, but less guarded. "So am I." A pause. "And Arjun? Stop feeling guilty about leaving. You're going to find your parents, and then you're going to go back and help. That's not running away. That's just taking the long way around."

She disappeared down the stairwell, leaving him alone with the stars.

He stayed on the rooftop for another hour, thinking about systems and collapse and the strange comfort of being understood by a stranger. When he finally slept, for the first time since the Event, he didn't dream of fire.

They reached Pune on Day Ten—Arjun's eighteenth day since the Event. The city was quieter than Mumbai, less chaotic. The military cantonment had imposed order early, and the university community had organized resources efficiently.

Arjun's parents were alive.

He found them in their apartment in Deccan Gymkhana—thinner, grayer, his mother's eyes red from crying, but alive. His mother wept when she saw him. His father, a retired bank manager, shook his hand formally before pulling him into an embrace.

"We thought—" his mother said. "Mumbai was burning, they said. The fires—"

"I'm here, Aai. I'm here."

They sat together for hours, sharing stories. His father had organized the building's residents. His mother had started a food-sharing system with the neighboring apartments. They had survived by doing what Indians had always done—relying on family, community, the ancient networks that predated any digital connection.

"What now, beta?" his father asked, later that night. "The world you built—the software, the systems—it's gone."

"I know." Arjun thought about Dharavi, about Kamala-mausi, about the purpose he had found in the narrow lanes of that self-sufficient world. "But I have other skills. Skills that matter now. And I made a promise. To go back and help."

"To Mumbai?"

"To Dharavi. There's an old woman there who believes we can rebuild. She's right. But we need people who can think systematically. Who can plan. Who can teach."

His mother took his hand. "Then go. But come back to us. Always come back."

"I will, Aai. I promise."

He stayed in Pune for a month—long enough to establish his parents in a sustainable situation, long enough to help organize the neighborhood cooperative that would keep them fed through the coming winter. Then he began the walk back to Mumbai.

Back to Dharavi. Back to work that mattered.
