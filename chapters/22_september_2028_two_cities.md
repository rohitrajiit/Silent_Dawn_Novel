### Two Cities

**September 2, 2028 — One Year Later**

*[Excerpted from Arjun Sharma's journal]*

*One year since the Event. I am writing this by candlelight in my room in Dharavi—a room I share with three others, where my bed is a mat on the floor and my desk is an old crate. By the standards of my previous life, this would be unimaginable poverty. By the standards of this world, I am wealthy beyond measure.*

*I have work that matters. I have community. I have purpose.*

*The municipal council met today to review the year's progress. The numbers are stark: we estimate Mumbai lost nearly half its population in the first six months. The very old, the very young, the sick, the unlucky. Those who couldn't adapt to a world without the systems that had sustained them.*

*But the other half is still here. Twelve million people, give or take, learning to live differently.*

*The water system is functioning—mostly hand pumps and gravity-fed distribution, but consistent. The food supply is stabilizing, built around urban farming, coastal fishing, and trade caravans from the interior. We have hospitals again, primitive by old standards but miraculous by new ones. Dr. Mehta's clinic in Dharavi saves lives every day with skills that were considered obsolete a generation ago.*

*We even have communication. The ham radio network stretches from Kerala to Gujarat now. I spoke to someone in Bangalore last week—a woman who remembered working for the same tech company I did. We laughed about the irony. All those quantum encryption projects, all that blockchain infrastructure, and here we are, talking through vacuum tubes and Morse code like it's 1920.*

*Priya and I were married three weeks ago.*

*I am still learning how to write those words. "Married." In the old world, that word meant ceremonies and registrations and announcements on social media. Here, it meant standing before Kamala-mausi—she was still alive then, barely—and making promises in front of the community that had become our family.*

*There was no priest. No mandap. No seven steps around a sacred fire. Priya said she didn't need any of that. "We've already walked a thousand steps together," she said. "That's enough for any vow."*

*She sleeps beside me now, on the mat that is barely wide enough for two. Her breathing is steady, her face slack with the particular peace of dreamless exhaustion. In the candlelight, I can see the calluses on her hands—from the ledgers, from the work, from the life neither of us expected.*

*I think often about the night we met. Lonavala, a hotel rooftop, the stars impossibly bright. She was preparing for UPSC and I was fleeing the ruins of everything I had built. We were strangers then—two people who had lost everything and weren't sure what to do next.*

*She followed me back to Mumbai. I still don't fully understand why. When I asked her once, months later, she said: "Because you were going somewhere that mattered. Because you didn't ask me to come—you would have gone alone. I didn't want you to go alone."*

*We don't talk about love the way the old movies did. There isn't time. There isn't space. What we have instead is this: she remembers that I forget to eat. I remember that she needs silence in the mornings. We have learned each other's rhythms the way you learn any skill—through repetition, through failure, through the slow accumulation of attention.*

*We fought once. During the monsoon, when everything was falling apart. I made a decision about resource allocation without consulting her, and when she found out, she was furious—not because the decision was wrong, but because I hadn't trusted her enough to include her. "This is what you do," she said. "You carry everything alone. You think that's strength, but it's arrogance. You think no one else can help." I didn't sleep that night. The next morning, I apologized. She was right. She's usually right about these things.*

*What does she represent to me? I've been thinking about this question since the wedding. The easy answer is hope—that life continues, that connection is possible. But that's not quite it.*

*She is the person I want to tell things to. That's the simplest way to say it. When something happens—good or bad—she is the first person I think of. When I'm trying to solve a problem, I imagine explaining it to her, and the explanation often clarifies my own thinking. When I'm afraid, which is often, her presence makes the fear manageable—not smaller, but shareable.*

*Kamala-mausi, in her last weeks, told me: "Love in the old world was about finding someone who made you happy. Love in this world is about finding someone who makes you useful." I didn't understand then. I think I understand now. Priya doesn't complete me—she challenges me. She doesn't make my burdens lighter—she helps me carry them. She doesn't save me from the world—she stands beside me in it.*

*That is what marriage means, in the new world. Not an ending, but a beginning. Not an escape, but a commitment.*

*We make decisions together. We laugh sometimes. That's more than most people have.*

*I think often about what was lost. The accumulated knowledge of humanity, stored on servers that will never wake up. The movies and music and books that existed only in digital form. The connections—social networks that spanned the globe, reduced to walking distance.*

*I think also about what was gained. The silence. The stars. The way people look at each other now, really look, because we can't hide behind screens anymore. The rediscovery of skills that seemed obsolete—sewing, farming, building things with hands.*

*Kamala-mausi died last month. Peacefully, in her sleep, surrounded by the community she had held together through the worst of it. The whole of Dharavi came out for her funeral procession. It lasted four hours. I wept like a child.*

*She was right about everything. The old ways had value. Human connections were everything. And those of us who could think systematically had a responsibility to use that gift in service of others.*

*Tomorrow I start teaching a new class—long-term planning, thinking in years rather than weeks. How to build institutions that will outlast our generation. The children who attend are seven, eight, nine years old. They will grow up in a different world, and I want them to be ready.*

*The sun is setting. The sky is beautiful—reds and oranges and purples, with no smog to dull the colors. Somewhere in the city, someone is playing a harmonium. The same bhajan I heard on that first night, when the world ended and I didn't know if I would survive to see the morning.*

*I survived. We survived. And now we build.*

*Whatever comes next, we will face it together.*
