**Part I: The Prosperity (2032)**

By the fifth year, Meridian was objectively the most prosperous settlement in the Republic.

Garrett had the statistics printed and posted quarterly: infant mortality at 2%. Literacy at 98%. Agricultural yield 40% above the regional average. Every citizen housed, fed, and productive. Every child educated. Every elder cared for.

Haven, by comparison, struggled with 8% infant mortality and chronic food insecurity. The Indianapolis communities barely maintained their pre-Event population. The Nashville Federation had fragmented into squabbling factions.

But Meridian grew. Meridian thrived. Meridian worked.

The system was simple: every adult received a productivity rating based on their contributions. Ratings determined rations, housing priority, access to luxuries like preserved pre-Event goods. High performers earned privileges. Low performers received remedial assignments. Those who refused to work at all were... encouraged to leave.

"It sounds harsh when you describe it in the abstract," Garrett told a visiting delegation from the Republic Council. "But watch how it functions. Everyone knows what's expected. Everyone understands the rules. There's no confusion, no favoritism, no endless debates about who deserves what."

Jessica Mitchell was part of that delegation—older now, Communications Director of the Republic, with the careful eyes of someone who had seen too much. She walked through Meridian's clean streets, observed its well-organized workshops, spoke with citizens who described their lives with satisfaction if not enthusiasm.

"It's impressive," she admitted that evening, as they shared a meal in Garrett's office. "I can't deny the results."

"Then why do you still oppose me?"

"Because results aren't everything." Jessica set down her fork. "I've spent ten years building communication networks. Connecting communities. Listening to what people actually want, not just what they need. And what I've learned is that survival isn't the goal—it's the starting point. People don't just want to live. They want to live for something."

"My people have purpose. Clear roles. Meaningful work."

"Assigned roles. Mandatory work." Jessica shook her head. "Garrett, I'm not here to argue philosophy. I'm here because we've heard rumors. About your refugee policy."

Garrett's expression didn't change. "We accept refugees from struggling communities. We give them housing, food, medical care. In exchange, they contribute labor until they've repaid the cost of their integration."

"Indentured labor."

"Investment recovery. These are people who arrived with nothing—starving, sick, desperate. We saved their lives. Is it unreasonable to ask for productivity in return?"

"How long does this 'repayment' take?"

"Depends on their skills. Most are integrated as full citizens within three to five years."

"And those with fewer skills?"

Garrett was silent for a moment. "Some debts take longer to repay."

Jessica leaned forward. "I have reports, Garrett. Families who've been in 'integration status' for seven years. Workers who are never quite productive enough to clear their obligations. A system where the rules keep changing to extend the timeline."

"Those reports are exaggerated."

"Are they?" Jessica stood. "I'm going to recommend the Republic Council investigate. Not because I think you're evil—I don't. I think you genuinely believe you're helping these people. But the road from 'efficiency' to 'exploitation' is shorter than you think, and I'm not sure you see where you are on it."

"And if I refuse an investigation?"

"Then Haven stops trading with Meridian. The other communities follow. You can be efficient in isolation, Garrett, but isolation is death." She walked to the door. "I'm not your enemy. I'm trying to give you a chance to fix this before it destroys everything you've built."

She left. And Garrett sat alone in his office, looking at the productivity charts on his wall, wondering when being right had stopped being enough.

**Part II: The Reckoning (2034)**

The investigation happened. Garrett couldn't stop it—Jessica had been right about that. The Republic Council sent observers, auditors, people asking uncomfortable questions about labor practices and debt structures and the difference between "contribution" and "coercion."

In the end, they found exactly what Jessica had described: a system that had started as reasonable integration and evolved, gradually, into something harder to defend. Refugees whose debts kept growing because of "housing costs" and "food expenses" and "administrative fees" that were never clearly explained. Workers who couldn't leave because they owed more than they'd ever be able to repay.

Garrett fought the findings. He argued context, intention, results. His people were alive. His community worked. The alternatives—letting refugees starve, turning them away at the gates—were worse.

But the Council wasn't interested in philosophy. They were interested in optics. The Republic was built on the principle that communities governed themselves, but there were limits. And Meridian had crossed them.

The final agreement was painful: release all integration workers from their debts. Implement transparent labor practices. Submit to annual audits. Garrett signed because the alternative was expulsion from the Compact and economic isolation.

"You've won," he told Jessica, when she came to observe the implementation. "I hope you're satisfied."

"I'm not trying to win, Garrett. I'm trying to prevent the thing I saw in you from spreading." She looked at him with something that might have been pity. "You built something impressive here. But somewhere along the way, you stopped seeing people as people and started seeing them as resources. That's not efficiency. That's just another kind of failure."

**Part III: The Unraveling (2040)**

The children were the problem.

Garrett had always known, in some abstract way, that the second generation would be different. They hadn't lived through the Starving Time. They didn't remember the chaos, the desperation, the math that required hard choices. They had grown up in Meridian's clean dormitories, attended Meridian's structured schools, absorbed Meridian's values of productivity and order.

But they had also grown up hearing about Haven. About the Republic. About communities where people voted on their leaders and debated their laws and made inefficient, beautiful, human choices that had nothing to do with optimization.

The first defections started in 2038. Young couples who wanted to start families somewhere less... structured. Skilled workers who had offers from other communities and no particular loyalty to the place that had raised them. Engineers and doctors and teachers—exactly the people Meridian couldn't afford to lose.

"They don't understand," Garrett told Rebecca, who was old now, tired, loyal to the end. "They think freedom means doing whatever you want. They don't realize that freedom without structure is just chaos waiting to happen."

"They understand fine," Rebecca said. "They just don't agree. And you can't make people agree, Garrett. That's the one thing efficiency can't solve."

He tried. He offered incentives, privileges, leadership positions to stay. He gave speeches about duty and legacy and the importance of maintaining what their parents had built. He reminded them, again and again, of the statistics—Meridian's prosperity, its safety, its success.

None of it mattered. The young people kept leaving. Three families in 2039. Seven in 2040. Fifteen in 2041.

By 2042, Meridian's population had fallen from its peak of four hundred to under two hundred. The schools were half-empty. The workshops ran on skeleton crews. The system that had made them prosperous was crumbling because there weren't enough people to sustain it.

And Garrett, seventy-three years old and increasingly frail, could only watch.

**Part IV: The End (2045)**

They called it a stroke, but Garrett knew better. It was time. Eighteen years of building, fighting, insisting on principles that no one else seemed to understand—it had worn him down to nothing.

Jessica Mitchell came to see him, in the end. She was in her sixties now, still running the Republic's communication networks, still traveling between communities, still connecting the world one message at a time.

"You didn't have to come," he said. Speaking was difficult. Everything was difficult.

"I wanted to." She sat beside his bed, in the room that had once been his office, when Meridian had hummed with purpose. Now it was quiet. Too quiet. "I wanted to tell you something."

"That I was wrong. I know."

"That you weren't entirely wrong." Jessica's expression was complicated. "Your methods failed. But your diagnosis was right. Democracy is slow. Deliberation has costs. Sometimes people die while we're debating what to do." She looked at the window. "Haven lost more people in the Starving Time than your compound did. That's a fact. I think about it sometimes."

"Then why fight me so hard?"

"Because the alternative was worse. You saved lives in the short term, but you built a system that couldn't outlast you. That's not survival—that's just a longer form of dying." She turned back to him. "Grace was right, all those years ago. You build compliance, not loyalty. And compliance doesn't pass to the next generation."

Garrett closed his eyes. His children—adopted, really, Meridian's children—were scattered across the Republic now. Living in Haven, in Indianapolis, in Nashville. Voting in assemblies. Debating in councils. Making all the inefficient, frustrating, human choices he had spent his life trying to prevent.

"I still think I was right," he said. "The math—"

"The math doesn't account for what people are willing to tolerate. That's the variable you always missed." Jessica stood. "Goodbye, Garrett. For what it's worth, I think history will remember you as someone who tried. That's more than most people can say."

He died three days later, in his sleep, with the productivity charts still hanging on the wall. Meridian's population was down to seventy-eight people—mostly elderly, mostly loyalists, mostly too tired to start over somewhere else.

Within a decade, they would join other communities. The buildings would be repurposed. The name would fade from memory.

But in Haven, in Indianapolis, in Nashville, the debate Garrett had started would continue. Every time a council moved too slowly, every time a vote delayed action, every time someone died waiting for consensus—someone would remember that there had been another way. A harder way. A way that worked, for a while, until it didn't.

That was Garrett Hollis's legacy: not the community he built, but the question he forced everyone to ask.

*What are we willing to sacrifice for survival? And is survival even the point?*
