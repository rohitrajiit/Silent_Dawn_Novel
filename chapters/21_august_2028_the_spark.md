### The Spark

**August 15, 2028 — The Scrapyard, Indiana**

Elias Thorne was nineteen years old, and he was the richest man in the world.

At least, that's how he felt standing in the center of the Scrapyard. To anyone else, it was ten acres of rusted industrial waste south of Indianapolis—a graveyard of trucks, transformers, and shipping containers. To Elias, it was a candy store.

"Copper," he whispered, peeling back the rubber insulation of a thick cable he'd pried from a dead transformer. The metal inside was bright, unoxidized, perfect. "Beautiful."

He coiled the wire carefully. In the old world, this would have been worth a few dollars at a recycling center. In the new world, it was priceless. It was the nervous system of the machine he was trying to build.

Elias lived in a shipping container he'd reinforced with sheet metal and insulated with scavenged car seats. His "lab" was a cleared-out mechanic's bay nearby. It smelled of grease, ozone, and obsession.

He wasn't interested in the politics of the Indianapolis Compact. He didn't care about the farming quotas or the defense patrols. He cared about one thing: The Hum.

He remembered the Hum. The low-frequency vibration of a world alive with electricity. It had stopped on that night in September, and the silence had been driving him crazy ever since.

"The physics didn't change," he muttered to himself, laying the copper coil on his workbench. "Maxwell's equations didn't repeal themselves. The grid fried, sure. The transformers melted. But induction? Induction is just magnets and motion."

He had built a rig. It was crude—a bicycle frame welded to a car alternator (rewound, painfully, by hand), connected to a terrifying array of capacitors he'd salvaged from microwave ovens.

"Test forty-two," he said. He liked the number.

He climbed onto the bike. The chain was connected to the alternator's pulley. He started to pedal.

The resistance was immediate. The magnetic fields fought him. He gritted his teeth and pushed harder. The chain clanked. The alternator whined—a sound he hadn't heard in a year.

*Whirrrrrrr.*

"Come on," he grunted. Sweat dripped into his eyes. "Wake up."

He had wired the output to a single automotive headlight bulb mounted on the bench. A 12-volt halogen. Simple. Dumb. Honest.

He pedaled faster. His legs burned. The alternator was spinning.

*Flicker.*

His heart hammered against his ribs. He pushed with everything he had, standing on the pedals, forcing the magnets to dance.

*Flicker. Flash.*

And then, steady.

A beam of yellow-white light cut through the gloom of the workshop. It was blinding. It was hot. It was the most beautiful thing Elias had ever seen.

"Yes!" he shouted, his voice cracking. "Yes! You see? You see?"

He was shouting at the ghosts of the old world. At the silence.

The light held for ten seconds. Twenty. Then his legs gave out, and the bulb dimmed to orange, then red, then dark.

Elias slumped over the handlebars, gasping for air, his chest heaving. The workshop was dark again. The silence rushed back in.

But it was different now. The silence wasn't empty. It was waiting.

He looked at the dark bulb, the afterimage still burning in his retina.

"I know you're in there," he whispered to the machine. "And I'm going to get you out."

He wasn't going to power the city. He wasn't going to restart the internet. But he had made light. He had turned motion into fire without a match.

"Step one," he said, wiping the sweat from his forehead. "Proof of concept."

He reached for his notebook. He needed better magnets. He needed a flywheel to smooth the output. He needed help.

He'd heard rumors of a woman in Indianapolis—Jessica Mitchell—who was organizing things. Who understood systems. Maybe she would understand this.

Elias Thorne smiled in the darkness. He wasn't just a scavenger anymore.

He was an engineer.
