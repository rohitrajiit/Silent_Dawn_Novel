### The Caravan

**September 10, 2027 — Kentucky**

Dr. Maya Chen had joined a caravan.

She hadn't planned to. Her initial strategy had been to stay put, to fortify her position, to wait out the first wave of chaos. But on Day Five, the situation in her Atlanta suburb had deteriorated to the point where staying meant dying.

The water had been the final straw. When the pressure in the pipes dropped to nothing—the pumping stations, which ran on electricity, had finally emptied their reservoirs—the remaining residents had begun fighting over the creek that ran through the neighborhood. A creek that was already polluted from road runoff, that would make anyone who drank from it sick within days.

Maya had packed what she could carry and started walking north. She had no particular destination in mind. Just... north. Away from the burning city. Toward something resembling safety, if such a thing still existed.

The caravan found her on the second day. Thirty-seven people, traveling together for protection. They had vehicles—old ones, pre-1980, mechanical ignitions, no electronic components. A caravan of vintage cars and trucks, carrying supplies that had been bartered, scavenged, and yes, in some cases, stolen.

The leader was a woman named Grace, former Army logistics officer, who had taken charge when the social fabric began to fray.

"We're heading for the mountains," Grace explained. "Tennessee, maybe Carolina. Get away from population centers. Find somewhere sustainable."

"I'm a scientist," Maya said. "Space weather. I know what happened. I might be useful."

Grace studied her with eyes that had seen too much in too few days. "Can you shoot?"

"Never have."

"Can you cook? Dress a wound? Set up shelter?"

"I can learn."

"Everyone learns now. That's the rule. Nobody's useless unless they choose to be." Grace handed her a canteen. "Welcome to the caravan, Dr. Chen. What do you know about water purification?"

As it turned out, Maya knew quite a bit—the chemistry, at least, if not the practical application. She became the caravan's unofficial water expert, teaching people how to boil and filter and treat the water they found. It wasn't glamorous. It wasn't astrophysics. But it was necessary, and that was enough.

The caravan moved slowly, limited by the speed of the oldest vehicles and the need to constantly scavenge for fuel. They siphoned gas from abandoned cars, knowing it wouldn't last forever, knowing that eventually they would have to find another way.

At night, they made camp in defensible positions—farmhouses, school parking lots, anywhere with good sightlines and multiple exits. Watches were set. Discipline was maintained. Grace ran the caravan like a military unit, which probably kept them alive.

On Day Eight, they encountered another group.

It was on a rural highway in northern Georgia, near a town that had already burned. The other group was smaller—maybe fifteen people—but better armed. They stood in the road, blocking the caravan's path.

"This is our territory," their leader called out. A big man, bearded, wearing camouflage. "Toll road now. You want to pass, you pay."

Grace stepped out of the lead vehicle, unarmed but unafraid. "We're not looking for trouble. Just passing through."

"That's fine. Toll is half your fuel, half your food. Standard rate."

Maya watched from the bed of the pickup truck where she'd been riding. She could see the calculation happening on Grace's face—the odds, the costs, the risks. Fighting would mean casualties on both sides. Paying would mean survival for fewer miles.

"Counter-offer," Grace said. "We have a doctor in our group. A real one, hospital-trained. We'll treat any wounded or sick you have, free of charge, and you let us pass."

The bearded man conferred with his people. After a long moment, he nodded. "Deal. But any funny business, and we start shooting."

They had three patients. One was a child with a broken arm that had been badly set. One was an elderly woman with an infected wound. One was a young man who had been shot in the leg and was developing fever from blood poisoning.

Dr. Sarah Okafor—a pediatrician from a suburb of Atlanta who had joined the caravan on Day Three—worked for hours with minimal supplies. Maya assisted where she could, holding flashlights, fetching water, sterilizing instruments over an open fire.

In the end, the child would heal cleanly. The elderly woman had perhaps a week. The young man—they couldn't save his leg, but they might save his life.

"You're good," the bearded man—his name was Roy—said to Dr. Okafor afterward.

"I try."

"You need anything, you come back this way. You've got friends here now."

They passed through without further incident. Grace allowed herself a small smile as they drove away.

"That's how it's going to work now," she said to Maya. "Skills. Trade. Relationships. The bullets will run out eventually. The skills won't."

Maya nodded. She thought about the civilization they'd lost—the billions of lines of code, the vast infrastructure, the accumulated knowledge accessible at the touch of a button. All of it, dependent on electricity. All of it, gone.

But people weren't gone. Knowledge wasn't gone. The ability to help each other wasn't gone.

Maybe, she thought, that would be enough.

Maybe.
