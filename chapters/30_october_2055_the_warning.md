### The Warning

**October 3, 2055 — Haven, Tennessee**

The alarm bells were ringing.

Dr. Maya Chen—eighty-five years old, retired, supposedly—hobbled up the stairs to the observatory tower. Her knees screamed in protest. Her lungs burned. She ignored them both.

"Report," she gasped as she reached the top.

Her successor, Maria Vasquez, was bent over the solar telescope. "Sunspot group 4417. Major flare activity detected eighteen hours ago. CME confirmed. Earth-directed."

Maya's heart clenched. Not again. Not again.

"Estimated impact?"

"Thirty-six hours. Maybe less." Maria looked up, her face pale. "It's not as big as the Event. Maybe G3 or G4 class. But it could still damage the telegraph lines. Maybe the radio equipment."

Maya walked to the window. Across Haven, the warning bells were still ringing. People were moving—calmly, purposefully, following the protocols that had been drilled into them for decades.

Disconnecting the telegraph lines. Powering down the generators. Moving essential electronics into the Faraday cages that every community now maintained.

They had twenty-eight years of preparation. Twenty-eight years of solar monitoring. Twenty-eight years of building redundancy, of training, of remembering.

"Contact Indianapolis," Maya said. "And Nashville. And everyone on the radio network. Full alert protocol."

"Already done." Maria put a hand on Maya's shoulder. "We're ready, Dr. Chen. Because of you."

Maya shook her head. "Not because of me. Because we learned. Because we remembered." She looked at the sun, that ancient fire that had nearly destroyed them, now reduced to a manageable threat. "The sun hasn't changed. We have."

The CME struck thirty-one hours later.

It was beautiful—the aurora danced across the sky, green and red and purple, visible as far south as Florida. People gathered on rooftops and in fields to watch, no longer afraid, only awed.

The telegraph lines survived. The radio stations survived. Some generators overloaded, but the backups held. Three minor fires; no casualties.

When it was over, Maya Chen sat on her porch and watched the sunrise. The same sun. The same silence.

But this time, the silence was chosen. This time, they had known it was coming.

"We made it," she whispered to the dawn. "We actually made it."
