### The Letter

> *Marking on envelope: "CARRIED BY RUNNER #41. ROUTE: INDY-STL-KC. FEE PAID: 1/2 SACK WHEAT. GODSPEED."*

**September 2, 2028 — One Year Later**

*Dear Emily,*

*I don't know if this will ever reach you. The message runners say they can get letters to California, but the route is long and dangerous. Still, I have to try.*

*It's been one year since the Event. I'm writing this by candlelight, in Mom and Dad's house, which has become something of a community center for our neighborhood. Dad leads the agricultural committee. Mom runs the water purification operation. They're doing well, considering everything.*

*I found my way home. It took me thirty-one days, walking and bicycling from Chicago. The things I saw on that journey... I won't describe them here. Some things should not be preserved in letters.*

*But I also saw good people. People who helped without asking for anything. People who shared what little they had. The Hutchins family, somewhere in Illinois, gave me a bicycle and two days of rest. A caravan out of Georgia taught me water purification. A priest in Kentucky bound my injured foot and fed me bread his community had baked from scratch.*

*We are capable of great darkness. The first weeks showed me that. But we are also capable of great light. The months since have proven it.*

*Michael and his wife Sara made it from Colorado. They arrived in November, after a harrowing journey over the mountains. They're living with Mom and Dad now. Their house has become crowded, but no one complains. Crowded is better than alone.*

*We don't know anything about you. We don't know if you're alive. We pray you are. (I've started praying again. Strange, the things that return when the world ends.)*

*Patricia's family had that cabin in Oregon—the one off-grid, with the solar panels. I keep hoping that you went there, that you found each other, that you're safe in the mountains.*

*The message runner who takes this letter says there are communities forming along the coast. He says there's a network developing, trading goods and information, rebuilding something like civilization. He says he's met people from California, that not everyone is gone.*

*Maybe you'll hear about us. Maybe someone will tell you that there's a family in Indianapolis who never stopped hoping. Who never stopped sending letters.*

*If you get this: we love you. We're waiting. Come home, if you can. Or send word, if you can't. Let us know you're alive.*

*The sun rises every day. The seasons change. Children are born. People fall in love and build homes and plant gardens. The world goes on, even without electricity, even without all the things we thought we needed.*

*We go on.*

*Your sister,*
*Jessica*
