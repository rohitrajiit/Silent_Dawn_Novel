**August 2028 — Indianapolis**

The meeting was held in what had once been a high school gymnasium. The basketball hoops had been removed for firewood during the winter, but the bleachers remained, and they were full.

Jessica Mitchell stood near the back, watching over three hundred people file into the space. Three hundred survivors from across the greater Indianapolis area—every community that had managed to maintain some form of organization through the winter. They had come by bicycle, by horse, by foot. Some had traveled for two days to be here.

"This is either the beginning of something," her father said beside her, "or the end of everything we've built."

"Optimistic as always, Dad."

"I've lived through enough to know that when people start talking about government, things get complicated."

The call had gone out in early July, passed along the message runner networks that Jessica had helped establish. A proposal: representatives from surviving communities would meet to discuss cooperation. Trade routes. Mutual defense. The sharing of resources and knowledge.

Some had called it premature. Others had called it essential. Everyone had come.

A woman climbed onto the stage at the front of the gymnasium—Colonel Patricia Reeves, formerly of the Indiana National Guard, now the closest thing the region had to a military authority. She had spent the winter keeping order in the refugee camps east of the city, a task that had aged her by decades.

"Thank you for coming," she said. Her voice was hoarse but carried. "I know the journey was difficult. I know you all have communities that need you. But I believe—we believe—that what we discuss today could determine whether those communities survive the next year. The next decade. The next century."

Murmurs rippled through the crowd. People who had spent a year focused on immediate survival were being asked to think in centuries.

"Let me be clear about what this is not," Reeves continued. "This is not the United States government. That government, as far as we can determine, no longer exists in any functional sense. We've had no contact with Washington. No contact with any surviving federal authority. We are, for all practical purposes, on our own."

Silence. Everyone had known this, but hearing it stated so baldly still hurt.

"What this is—what it could be—is a beginning. A way for independent communities to work together without losing their independence. A framework for resolving disputes, coordinating resources, and defending against... threats."

"What threats?" someone called from the crowd.

Reeves's jaw tightened. "Three weeks ago, a group of approximately two hundred armed individuals attempted to seize control of the farming collective near Lafayette. They were repelled, but seven people died. Last month, a community near Terre Haute was entirely overrun. We don't know how many survivors there were. And these are just the incidents we know about."

The murmurs grew louder. This was the nightmare that haunted every community leader—the knowledge that their safety depended on remaining invisible, and invisibility was becoming harder as resources stabilized and raiders grew bolder.

"We can fight these battles alone," Reeves said. "Or we can fight them together. That's the choice we're here to make."

The debate lasted three days.

There were factions. Of course there were factions. There were always factions.

The Militarists, led by Reeves and the surviving National Guard elements, wanted a centralized defense force. Every community would contribute personnel and resources. A unified command would deploy where needed.

The Federalists, represented by former local government officials like Jessica's father, wanted something looser—a council of representatives with limited powers, focused on coordination rather than command.

The Libertarians—mostly younger survivors who had built their communities from nothing—wanted even less. Trade agreements, mutual defense pacts, but no overarching authority. "We didn't survive the collapse of one government to create another," one of them argued.

And there were the Skeptics, who questioned whether any formal structure was necessary or desirable. "We've managed for a year," an old farmer from the southern counties said. "We'll manage for another. Why invite complication?"

But the most unexpected voice came from a fifth faction—one that had coalesced quietly among the communities that had survived the winter with the lowest mortality rates.

Garrett Hollis rose from the bleachers on the first morning. Tall, silver-haired, still wearing the remnants of what had once been an expensive suit. Before the Event, he had been a senior partner at McKinsey, specializing in organizational restructuring. After the Event, he had turned his "hobby investment"—a prepper compound in rural Ohio—into one of the most successful survivor communities in the region.

"With respect to Colonel Reeves," he said, his voice carrying the practiced confidence of a thousand boardroom presentations, "I don't think we're asking the right question."

Reeves nodded for him to continue.

"The question isn't whether we need structure. Of course we need structure. The question is what kind of structure actually works." Hollis scanned the crowd. "I've spent the last year running a community of three hundred and twelve people. We had eight percent mortality during the Starving Time. Eight percent. Does anyone here want to share their numbers?"

Silence. Jessica felt her stomach tighten. Haven had lost nearly thirty percent of its elderly and children during the worst months.

"Terre Haute," Hollis continued, "which operated on what they called 'community consensus,' lost forty-three percent. Bloomington, which held town meetings to decide rationing policies, lost thirty-eight percent. The pattern is consistent across every community I've studied. The more 'democratic' the decision-making process, the higher the death toll."

"Correlation isn't causation," someone called out.

"No. It isn't." Hollis smiled without warmth. "But in my compound, when the first freeze came, I ordered mandatory sixteen-hour workdays for all able-bodied adults. We built insulated shelters. We preserved every calorie of food. We exiled three families who refused to comply." He paused. "Those families died on the road. The remaining three hundred and nine people survived. All of them. Every single child under the age of ten made it through the winter."

"You're describing tyranny," Jessica's father said.

"I'm describing survival, Mr. Mitchell." Hollis turned to face him. "Your daughter walked three hundred miles through chaos. Did she stop to take votes at every crossroad? Did she convene a council to decide whether to share her water with strangers? No. She made hard decisions, quickly, because that's what survival requires."

"That was an individual—"

"And now we're building a society. A society that will face hard decisions—about resources, about defense, about who lives and who dies when the next crisis comes. And it will come." Hollis addressed the full assembly now. "The question before us isn't whether we want freedom or authority. It's whether we want the luxury of pretending we can have both."

Jessica found herself pulled into the Federalist camp, though she wasn't sure she belonged there. She spoke on the second day, standing at the front of the gymnasium with three hundred pairs of eyes on her—and Garrett Hollis's cold attention fixed on her from the third row.

"I walked from Chicago to Indianapolis," she said. "Three hundred miles, alone, through chaos. I saw what happens when there's no structure. People died not because resources didn't exist, but because there was no way to move them to where they were needed. Communities that could have helped each other didn't even know the others existed."

She paused, gathering her thoughts.

"I also saw what happens when people work together. The networks we've built—the message runners, the trade routes—those exist because individual communities chose to cooperate. Nobody forced them. They did it because it worked."

"So what are you proposing?" someone called out.

"I'm proposing we formalize what's already happening. Not create a new government that controls everything, but establish agreed-upon rules for how communities interact. How disputes are settled. How information is shared. How we respond when one of us is threatened."

"And who enforces these rules?"

"We all do. Or none of us do. That's the point." She looked around the gymnasium. "The old world failed because it was built on systems that were too complex, too fragile, too dependent on things that could break. Whatever we build now needs to be different. It needs to be... human-scale. Based on trust and relationships, not on distant authority."

Hollis stood again before she could sit down.

"Ms. Mitchell, I respect your journey. I respect what you've built with the runner network. But let me ask you something directly." He stepped into the aisle, commanding the room's attention. "During the Starving Time, when your parents' community had to decide how to ration grain—did they vote?"

Jessica hesitated. "There were discussions—"

"Did they vote?"

"The council decided."

"The council. An unelected body of people who happened to be in charge when the crisis hit." Hollis nodded slowly. "And how many of those 'discussions' delayed action? How many people died while the community debated whether it was fair to give children larger portions than adults? Whether it was right to prioritize the young over the elderly?"

"That's not—"

"I have the records from Terre Haute, Ms. Mitchell. Three days. They spent three days debating rationing protocols while their granaries emptied. By the time they reached consensus, fourteen people had starved. Fourteen people who would be alive today if someone—anyone—had simply made a decision."

The gymnasium had gone quiet. Jessica could feel the crowd shifting, the weight of Hollis's argument pressing down on them. He wasn't wrong. That was the terrible thing. He wasn't entirely wrong.

"You want to build something human-scale," Hollis continued. "Something based on trust and relationships. It's a beautiful vision. But I've seen what happens when beautiful visions meet ugly reality. Trust doesn't feed a starving child. Relationships don't stop a raider with a gun. What stops them is organized power, deployed effectively, under unified command."

"And who commands?" Jessica asked. "You?"

For the first time, Hollis's composure flickered. "I'm not asking to be a king. I'm asking us to be honest about what it takes to survive. Democracy is a luxury of abundance. We are not abundant. We may never be abundant again. The question is whether we have the courage to admit that, or whether we'd rather feel virtuous while we bury our dead."

The debate continued for two more days, but something fundamental had shifted. The abstract arguments about governance had become concrete—about specific deaths, specific failures, specific choices that haunted every leader in the room.

By the third day, they had a framework. But it was a framework forged in the fire of genuine disagreement, and the scars of that forging would shape the Republic for decades to come.

---

They called it the Indianapolis Compact.

It wasn't a constitution. It wasn't a government. It was, as Jessica had suggested, a formalization of what was already happening—a set of agreements that communities could choose to join.

The core elements were simple:

**Article One: Mutual Recognition.** Each signatory community was recognized as sovereign within its territory. Internal governance was an internal matter.

**Article Two: Free Passage.** Citizens of signatory communities could travel freely through other signatory territories, subject to local customs and reasonable regulations.

**Article Three: Trade Rights.** Signatory communities agreed to basic standards for trade—weights, measures, rules against fraud. Disputes would be resolved by arbitration.

**Article Four: Mutual Defense.** An attack on one signatory community was considered an attack on all. Each community committed to providing assistance according to its means.

**Article Five: The Assembly.** Representatives would meet twice yearly to address common concerns, resolve disputes, and amend the Compact as needed.

That was it. Five articles. No president, no congress, no bureaucracy. Just an agreement among free communities to treat each other fairly and stand together against threats.

Forty-seven communities signed within the first month. By the end of the year, the number would triple.

"It's not perfect," Tom Mitchell said, watching the signatures accumulate. "It leaves too many questions unanswered. What happens when communities disagree about Article Four? Who decides what counts as 'according to its means'?"

"We figure it out as we go," Jessica said. "That's how everything works now."

"That's what worries me."

But he signed anyway. They all did. Because imperfect cooperation was better than perfect isolation, and the winter had taught them what isolation meant.
