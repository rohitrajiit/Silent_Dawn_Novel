### The Farmer

> *"We called him the Gardener. Most people had forgotten he used to run the whole thing. He was just this old man who grew the best tomatoes in the valley and never talked about the past."*

**April 2036 — Ojai Valley, California**

Adrian Vance was on his knees in the dirt when his daughter found him.

The tomato plants needed staking. The spring rains had been heavy—heavier than anyone remembered from before—and the plants were bending under the weight of new growth. Adrian worked methodically, tying each stem to its support with strips of salvaged cloth. His hands, once manicured weekly at a Beverly Hills spa, were now permanently stained with soil.

"Father."

He didn't look up. "The Roma variety is doing well this year. Should have a good harvest by July."

"Father." Maria's voice carried the edge it always did when she was about to tell him something he didn't want to hear. "There's been a development."

"There's always a development. That's why I left the council to you." He finished tying the stake and moved to the next plant. "Handle it."

"This one you need to hear."

Adrian sighed and sat back on his heels, finally looking at his daughter. She was forty-three now, streaks of gray in her dark hair, the permanent exhaustion of leadership carved into her face. She had taken his seat on the council seven years ago, when he had finally convinced people that he really meant to stay retired.

"What is it?"

"The Eastern Compact is sending an ambassador. Someone from the Midwestern Republic." Maria sat on the low wall that bordered the garden. "They want to discuss trade routes. Technology sharing. Maybe... reunification discussions."

"Reunification?"

"Something. Some kind of continental framework." She hesitated. "They want to meet with the founders. The people who built the early structures. That means you."

Adrian returned his attention to the plants. "I'm not a founder. I'm a man who built a bunker and got lucky."

"You're the person who opened the gates. Who started the coalition that became the Compact. Whether you like it or not, you're part of the founding narrative."

"Narratives are just stories. Stories can be rewritten."

"Not this one. Not yet." Maria crouched beside him, forcing him to meet her eyes. "I know you want to be forgotten. I know you think stepping away was the only good thing you ever did. But the people who built this—they want to build something bigger now. Something that connects the whole country. And they think the founders should be there. All of them."

Adrian was quiet for a long moment. The wind rustled through the valley, carrying the scent of orange blossoms from the groves down the hill. This place—this small farm in Ojai, this quiet life of growing things—had been his sanctuary for seven years. His penance, maybe. His escape.

"Do you remember the woman with the child?" he asked.

Maria's expression shifted. "Which one?"

"Day Twenty. The first group that came to the gates. There was a woman—young, maybe twenty-five—and she was holding a toddler. A little boy. She held him up to the camera, to show me." His voice was steady, but something in his eyes was not. "I watched her do it. And then I told Torres to fire a warning shot. And she left. With her son. Into chaos."

"You've told me this story."

"I've never told you the end of it." Adrian pulled a weed from beside the tomato plant, methodical, precise. "Three years ago, a man came to the farm. Said he recognized me from before. Said his wife had died on the road outside my compound, trying to find shelter after we turned her away. She was holding their son when she died. The boy survived—someone else took him in. The man raised him alone in San Bernardino. He came to tell me that."

"What did you say?"

"I said I was sorry. The most useless words in any language." Adrian looked at his hands—the soil under his nails, the calluses from actual work. "He didn't want revenge. He didn't want compensation. He just wanted me to know. To carry it. He said, 'You should know what your decisions meant. Not in abstract. In specific. My wife's name was Carmen. My son's name is Diego. She died because you thought she wasn't valuable enough.'"

Maria was silent.

"That's why I can't be part of the founding narrative," Adrian said. "Because the real story isn't about opening the gates. It's about closing them first. It's about Diego's mother dying on the road. It's about all the other Carmens, all the other Diegos, all the people who weren't valuable enough."

"But you opened them eventually. You changed."

"Did I? Or did I just get tired of being haunted?" He stood, brushing dirt from his knees. "The Compact isn't about me. It's about Commander Reyes and the council and all the people who built something from the wreckage. Let them tell the story. I'll stay here and grow tomatoes."

---

The ambassador came anyway.

She arrived on a spring morning, riding a horse up the dirt road that led to Adrian's farm. Young—maybe thirty—with the weathered look of someone who had traveled far. She introduced herself as Katherine Zhou, representative of the Midwestern Republic's Department of External Affairs.

"Mr. Vance. I've come a long way to meet you."

"You've wasted your trip." Adrian didn't stop working. He was pruning the apple trees today. "I don't give interviews. I don't attend ceremonies. I grow food and I keep to myself."

"I'm not here for an interview." Katherine dismounted and tied her horse to the fence. "I'm here because my grandmother told me to find you."

Adrian paused, shears in hand. "Your grandmother."

"Zhou Mei-Ling. She was one of the first refugees from San Francisco. She made it to a settlement near Sacramento, but they were overrun by raiders in '28. She heard there was safety in the south—a man who had opened his compound to survivors. She tried to reach you."

"Did she?"

"She turned back. The roads were too dangerous. She went east instead, eventually made it to Nevada, then Arizona, then the Midwest." Katherine's voice was calm, factual. "She died last year. But before she died, she told me about you. About the compound. About the legend of the man who built an ark and then opened the gates."

"It's not much of a legend."

"Legends never are, up close." Katherine studied him—the stooped posture, the gray beard, the hands of a farmer. "My grandmother said you probably saved thousands of lives. She also said you probably killed thousands more by the choices you made. She said both could be true at the same time."

"Your grandmother was wise."

"She was Chinese. We're comfortable with contradictions." Katherine smiled slightly. "I didn't come here to praise you or condemn you. I came because we're building something new. A continental framework—connections between the Pacific, the Midwest, the South. Trade routes, communication networks, shared standards. It'll take decades. Maybe generations. But we want the people who started this—who proved it was possible—to know it's happening."

Adrian set down the shears. "I didn't prove anything. I just survived."

"That's all any of us did. But some of us survived in ways that made it possible for others to survive too. That matters." Katherine untied a satchel from her saddle and handed it to him. "Letters. From survivors across the continent. People who made it because of the networks that started here. They wanted you to have them."

Adrian took the satchel. It was heavy with paper—dozens of letters, maybe hundreds.

"I'm not asking you to come back to politics," Katherine said. "I'm not asking you to be a symbol or a leader. I'm just asking you to know that it worked. The thing you started—it worked. And it's spreading."

She remounted her horse and looked down at him.

"My grandmother also said one more thing. She said, 'Tell him the boy lived.' She wouldn't explain what that meant. But she said you would understand."

She rode away down the dirt road, leaving Adrian alone with a satchel of letters and a fragment of information that might have been anything.

*The boy lived.*

Diego? The son of the woman at the gates? Or another boy, another story, another fragment of the chaos he had tried to contain?

He didn't know. He would probably never know.

But he opened the satchel and began to read the letters, one by one, sitting in the shade of the apple tree. Stories of survival. Stories of connection. Stories of communities that had grown from seeds he hadn't planted, watered by rains he would never see.

When Maria came to check on him that evening, she found him still there, surrounded by paper, his face wet with tears he hadn't known he was shedding.

"Father?"

"I think," he said slowly, "I might come to the meeting after all."

"What changed?"

He looked at the letters scattered around him. "Everything. Nothing." He smiled—the first real smile she had seen from him in years. "Someone told me the boy lived. I don't know which boy. But it's enough to know some of them did."

Maria sat beside him, and together they watched the sun set over the valley—the same sun that had burned the old world away, now warming the crops of the new one.

Some things, it turned out, could grow back.
