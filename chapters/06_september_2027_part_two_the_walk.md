**September 4, 2027 — Indiana**

Jessica Mitchell had been walking for three days.

She had left Chicago carrying a backpack full of everything she thought she'd need: water bottles, protein bars, a first aid kit, a hunting knife she'd bought impulsively during a camping phase that never materialized, a paper map of the Midwest (kept in a drawer for aesthetic purposes, never consulted), and a change of clothes.

She had learned many things in those three days.

She had learned that a paper map was worth more than its weight in gold. That water was heavier than she'd imagined. That walking twenty miles a day—which had seemed reasonable in theory—was impossible on highways clogged with abandoned cars and scattered with debris and, increasingly, with less pleasant things she tried not to look at directly.

She had learned that other travelers on the road fell into categories. The dazed wanderers—people who had left urban areas with no plan, driven by instinct or panic or denial. The strategists—often former military or outdoor enthusiasts—who moved with purpose, who made her nervous because purpose could cut many ways. The families, slow-moving clusters of adults and children, vulnerable and desperate.

And the predators. She had seen them on Day Two, a group of young men outside a convenience store that had already been looted. They hadn't bothered her—there were easier targets—but she had quickened her pace and not stopped until dark.

On Day Three, she made a decision. She would avoid the main highways. She would stick to back roads, to residential neighborhoods, to paths through farmland. It would take longer, but she was beginning to understand that speed mattered less than survival.

She was somewhere south of Kankakee, Illinois, when she met the farmer.

He was standing at the end of his driveway, shotgun cradled in his arms, watching her approach with the wariness that had become universal.

"Just passing through," she called out, keeping her hands visible. "Not looking for trouble."

"Indianapolis?"

She blinked. "How did you know?"

"You're the third today, heading that direction. People walking home to family." He lowered the shotgun slightly. It was as close to an invitation as she was likely to get. "You need water?"

"I—yes. Please. I can pay. I have—" What did she have? Cash that was becoming increasingly meaningless. Credit cards that were worthless plastic.

"Keep your money," the farmer said. "But if you've got news from the city, I'll trade water for information."

She walked up the driveway. Up close, the farmer was maybe sixty, weathered face, hands that had known work. His farmhouse had a well, she would later learn—a hand-pump well, the old kind, never converted to electric.

He had also never bought a modern tractor.

"Name's Earl Hutchins," he said. "My wife Rebecca is inside. You're welcome to stay the night, if you want. We've got room."

Jessica felt something crack inside her—the armor of hypervigilance she'd been wearing since Chicago. "I'm Jessica. And... yes. Thank you. I'd like that."

That night, she ate fresh vegetables from the Hutchinses' garden, cooked over a wood-burning stove that Earl's father had installed in 1963 and that Rebecca had refused to remove despite two decades of gentle lobbying.

"I always said the old ways had value," Rebecca said, ladling bean soup into bowls. "Earl thought I was being sentimental."

Earl shrugged. "I'm man enough to admit when I'm wrong."

After dinner, they sat on the porch and watched the stars emerge—clearer than Jessica had ever seen them, without the light pollution of cities. The Milky Way stretched across the sky like a river of light.

"It's beautiful," she said.

"It is," Earl agreed. "Everything beautiful has a cost, though. That beauty up there—it cost us everything down here."

Jessica nodded. She thought of her apartment in Chicago, probably already being looted. Her career, evaporated. Her carefully constructed life, dissolved.

"I'm walking to my parents," she said. "In Indianapolis. I don't know if they're okay. I don't know if the city is okay. I don't know anything."

"Not knowing is the hardest part," Rebecca said. "Worse than knowing, even when the knowing is bad."

"Will you make it?" Earl asked. "You seem like a city girl. No offense."

"None taken. I don't know if I'll make it. But I have to try."

Earl was quiet for a long moment. Then he said, "I've got a bicycle in the barn. Old ten-speed, pre-electronic, been there twenty years. I'll tune it up in the morning. It'll get you there faster."

Jessica's eyes burned. "I can't take—"

"You're not taking. I'm giving. There's a difference." He looked at the stars. "We're all that's left now—just people, helping or hurting. I prefer helping."

Jessica stayed two more days, recovering her strength, learning what she could from the Hutchinses about surviving in a world that suddenly demanded survival. Then she took the bicycle and rode south.

She thought about Earl often in the weeks that followed. She wondered if he and Rebecca were still alive, still helping strangers who walked up their driveway.

She hoped they were. She needed to believe some bright points existed in the darkening world.
