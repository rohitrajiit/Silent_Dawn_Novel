**March 17, 2032 — The Scrapyard, Indiana**

The smoke was visible for twenty miles.

Elias was in Indianapolis when the messenger reached him—a boy on horseback, his face streaked with sweat and ash. He didn't need to hear the words. He already knew.

He rode through the night, arriving at dawn.

The Academy was gone.

Where the main workshop had stood—a converted warehouse filled with tools, benches, half-built generators, and the dreams of a dozen young engineers—there was now a skeleton of charred beams. The forge was a crater of melted metal. The library annex, home to Elias's carefully preserved collection of technical manuals, was ash.

And on the one standing wall, painted in letters three feet high:

**THE SUN HAS SPOKEN**

A crowd had gathered. Workers, students, neighbors—they stood in a loose ring, their faces gray with shock. Some were crying. Others just stared.

Elias walked through the ruins like a man in a dream.

"Where is Daniel?"

No one answered.

"*Where is Daniel?*"

A woman stepped forward. Ruth—the blacksmith's wife, who had been tending the night fire when it started. Her hands were bandaged, her voice raw.

"He went back in," she whispered. "For the books. He said... he said we couldn't lose the books."

"And?"

Ruth's face crumpled.

"The roof came down. By the time we... by the time..."

Elias's legs stopped working. He sat down on a pile of rubble that had been his workbench, and he stayed there for a long time.

---

They found Daniel's body in the library annex, curled around a stack of textbooks he had tried to carry out. His hands were burned to the bone, but he had held on until the end.

*Electricity from First Principles.* *Practical Circuitry.* *The Engineer's Companion.*

He had saved three books.

They buried him that afternoon, in the small cemetery behind the Scrapyard where Elias's parents had been laid to rest years before the Event. The grave was simple—a wooden marker with his name and dates.

**Daniel Miller**
**2015–2032**
**He built the light.**

Elias stood at the graveside long after the others had left. The sun was setting, turning the sky the color of fire.

*The sun sees.*

*The sun has spoken.*

The words echoed in his head, acid and meaningless.

He had been so patient. So determined to understand. He had told Daniel—told everyone—that the fanatics needed compassion, not violence. That faith yielded slowly. That building was the answer.

And Daniel had believed him.

Daniel had believed that knowledge was worth dying for, because Elias had taught him that. Elias had made the library. Elias had preached the gospel of preservation. And when the fire came, Daniel had gone back for the sacred texts.

*You killed him,* a voice whispered in Elias's head. *You and your patience. You and your hope. You built a temple and they burned it, and a boy died trying to save your idols.*

**March 20, 2032 — Indianapolis**

The Council chamber was packed.

General Reeves sat at the head of the table, flanked by the regional leaders who had traveled through the night to attend. Jessica Mitchell was there, her runner network having spread the news faster than any telegraph. Grace had come from Haven. Even Samuel Torres attended, his face grim with vindication.

And in the center of the room, silent, Elias Thorne.

"We know who did this," Torres said. "The True Children of the Sun have claimed responsibility. They sent a letter to the Haven post office boasting about it."

He produced the letter and read aloud:

*"The Academy of wires was a temple to the old sins. The boy who died was a sacrifice to the Machine-god you rebuild in your arrogance. We act in accordance with the Sun's will. There will be no warning fires. There will be no second chances. Every wire you string, we will cut. Every machine you build, we will burn. The Machine must not rise again. —Brother Ash, Servant of the True Light."*

Torres set the letter down.

"This is terrorism. This is murder. I move that the Midwestern Republic authorize a military expedition to locate and destroy the True Children of the Sun."

"Seconded," said a voice from the back. Then another. And another.

Reeves raised a hand for silence. "The motion is on the table. Discussion?"

Grace stood. "I understand the rage. I share the rage. Daniel was a child. But if we respond with violence—"

"Violence has already been done!" Torres interrupted. "By *them*. We're not starting a war; we're ending one they declared."

"And when we kill Brother Ash? What about his followers? What about the next zealot who rises to take his place?"

"Then we kill him too."

"And the next? And the next?" Grace's voice was steady, but her hands were shaking. "We spent years building something different. A society based on consent, not force. If we become the very thing we fought against—"

"Daniel is dead, Grace. Your principles didn't save him."

Silence.

All eyes turned to Elias.

He sat with his head bowed, staring at his hands—the hands that had built generators, strung wire, taught a boy to make light from motion. The hands that had been too gentle to save him.

"Elias," Reeves said softly. "You knew Daniel better than anyone. What do you want us to do?"

---

He didn't answer for a long moment.

When he spoke, his voice was barely audible.

"I want him back."

The words hung in the air.

"I want to un-see the body. I want to un-bury him. I want to go back to the day before the fire and post guards and never let him near those books." He looked up, and his eyes were red. "But I can't have what I want. None of us can. So the question isn't what I want. It's what I'm willing to become to get it."

He stood.

"I know what Torres is feeling. I feel it too. The rage. The need to *do* something. To hurt the people who hurt us. And maybe..." He paused. "Maybe if I give in to that, I'll feel better for a day. A week. Maybe I'll watch Brother Ash hang and feel like justice has been done."

"And then?"

"And then I'll have to live with being the man who chose revenge over..." He gestured vaguely. "Over everything else I believed in."

"So you'd let Daniel's murder go unanswered?" Torres's voice was incredulous.

"No." Elias's jaw tightened. "But I won't answer it the way they want me to. They burned my school because they wanted me to stop building. If I stop—if I turn into a general instead of an engineer—they win."

"They killed a *child*, Elias."

"I know." For the first time, his voice cracked. "I *know*. And I will carry that the rest of my life. But Daniel died for the books. For the knowledge. For the idea that we could rebuild something worth having. If I betray that—if I become a man who burns instead of builds—then he died for nothing."

He walked toward the door.

"Don't hunt them," he said. "Not yet. Not because of me. But before we start a war, we should at least try to end one. Maya Chen has an idea. About the telescope. About showing Brother Ash what the sun really is."

Torres laughed bitterly. "You're going to *educate* the man who murdered your student?"

Elias stopped at the threshold.

"Probably not. He probably won't listen. He'll probably see the same physics Maya sees and call it proof of divine intention." He turned back. "But if I don't try—if I let the rage win without even attempting something else first—then I'll never know. And I'll spend the rest of my life wondering if Daniel might still be alive if I'd been a little more patient. A little less eager to fight."

He left.

The vote was deadlocked. Grace's faction, Reeves's moderates, and Torres's hawks circled each other for hours.

In the end, they agreed to wait. To try Maya's approach. To give diplomacy one chance.

But everyone knew it was the last chance.

**March 24, 2032 — The Scrapyard, Indiana**

Elias stood in the ruins, alone.

He had spent the day salvaging what he could—a few tools, a handful of unburned pages, the twisted remains of his first generator. It wasn't much. It was almost nothing.

He sat on the foundation stone where the forge had been.

*Do I stop?*

The question had been circling him for days. The practical one—whether to rebuild the Academy, whether to continue the telegraph work, whether to keep teaching.

But also the deeper one. The one that had nothing to do with buildings or wires.

*Do I stop being who I was?*

He thought about Daniel. About the way the boy had looked at the first working lightbulb—wonder and terror and joy all mixed together. About the questions he had asked. The conviction that they were doing something that *mattered*.

*He died for this.*

*Does that mean I have to keep living for it?*

He picked up a charred piece of wood. It crumbled in his hands.

*They want me to stop. They want me to rage. They want me to prove that building leads to violence, that progress leads to death.*

*What do I want?*

He closed his eyes.

He saw the lightbulb, glowing steady in the dark.

He saw Daniel's face.

He saw the telegraph line, humming with messages from Chicago.

And he saw Brother Ash, somewhere in the mountains, watching the smoke rise and believing he had won.

"No," Elias said.

It wasn't loud. It wasn't defiant. It was just a word, spoken to the ashes.

"No."

He stood up.

He didn't know if Maya's telescope would work. He didn't know if Brother Ash could be convinced. He didn't know if the rage would ever stop gnawing at him.

But he knew what Daniel would have wanted.

*He built the light.*

Elias looked at his hands—soot-stained, calloused, empty.

Then he started walking toward the pile of salvaged tools.

There was work to do.
