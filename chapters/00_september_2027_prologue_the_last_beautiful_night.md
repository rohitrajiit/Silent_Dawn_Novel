## Prologue: The Last Beautiful Night

**September 1, 2027 — 11:47 PM EST**

Dr. Maya Chen had never seen the aurora borealis from her rooftop in Atlanta. 

Tonight, the sky was on fire.

Ribbons of green and crimson cascaded across the heavens, dancing with an intensity that made her chest ache with wonder. She had spent fifteen years at NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center, watching solar cycles, tracking sunspots, modeling coronal mass ejections. She knew, intellectually, what this display meant.

But knowing and accepting are different animals entirely.

Her phone buzzed—the last time it would ever buzz. It was her colleague, Dr. James Whitmore, from the Boulder facility.

"Maya, the proton flux is off the charts. We're looking at a Dst index that'll make 1859 look like a flashlight."

"I know, James." Her voice was steady. Professional. The voice of a scientist watching the end of the world in real-time. "How long?"

"The CME is traveling at 3,000 kilometers per second. It'll hit our magnetosphere in—" Static crackled. "—maybe six hours. Maybe less. Maya, this is it. This is the big one."

She looked up at the sky again. Neighbors were emerging from their homes, phones raised, filming the spectacular light show. Children pointed and laughed. Couples held hands. No one knew. How could they?

How do you explain that the most beautiful thing they'd ever witnessed was actually the death knell of everything they'd taken for granted?

"James, are you going home to your family?"

The line was already dead.
