Sarah Mitchell woke to silence.

Not the peaceful silence of a Sunday morning, but an absence—a void where the hum of civilization should have been. No refrigerator humming in the kitchen. No distant drone of highway traffic. No gentle whir of the ceiling fan that had lulled her to sleep for thirty-two years.

She reached for her phone on the nightstand. The screen remained dark, indifferent to her touch. She pressed the power button. Nothing. She plugged it into the charger. Nothing.

"Tom?" She shook her husband's shoulder. "Tom, something's wrong."

Tom Mitchell, a man who had weathered thirty-five years of marriage, three children, two recessions, and a global pandemic, sat up slowly. His eyes found the useless clock on the wall—an old analog piece that still ticked faithfully. 6:24.

"Power's out," he said.

"It's more than that." Sarah's voice carried an edge of something primal. "Listen."

They listened. Outside their suburban Indianapolis home, there was no sound of garbage trucks beginning their morning rounds. No planes overhead. No sirens—there were always sirens in a city this size. Just... birds. Insects. The rustle of wind through the maple trees they'd planted when their oldest was born.

Tom walked to the window and pulled back the curtain. Their neighbor, Frank, was standing in his driveway, staring at his SUV with the hood open. Across the street, the Hendersons were doing the same. At the corner, a man was trying repeatedly to start his motorcycle.

"I'm going to check the car," Tom said.

The Toyota Camry, purchased just eight months ago with its advanced computer systems and hybrid engine, was a very expensive paperweight. Tom turned the key. Nothing. Not even the click of the starter. He popped the hood and stared at an engine he didn't really understand, as if looking at it would provide answers.

"Nothing?" Sarah had followed him, still in her robe, coffee maker abandoned on the counter behind her.

"Nothing."

Frank walked over, his face pale. "Same here. Same everywhere, as far as I can tell. I tried walking to the Speedway on Main—figured I'd at least get some information. Doors were locked. Store was dark. There wasn't a single working car on the road. Not one, Tom."

The newer cars, anyway. Tom would learn later that the dividing line was roughly 1975—before that, vehicles ran on purely mechanical systems. Points and condensers. Carburetors. No computer chips to fry. But by 2027, there were precious few of those antiques still operational. The rest—the hybrids, the electrics, the computer-laden machines that could parallel park themselves—were now two-ton roadblocks.

It wasn't just cars. The geomagnetic storm had induced currents in every length of wire on the planet. Power lines had become antennas for destruction, channeling billions of watts of induced electricity into a grid designed for controlled flow. Transformers had exploded from coast to coast. The silicon chips that ran everything—everything—had been burned out by electromagnetic pulse and radiation surge. There was no fix for this. You couldn't just flip a breaker and wait. The machines themselves were dead, their microscopic circuits permanently fused.

Sarah remembered something then—a fragment from the night before. She'd gotten up around 2 AM to use the bathroom and noticed an odd light through the window. Too tired to investigate, she'd gone back to sleep.

"The lights," she said. "There were strange lights in the sky last night."

Frank nodded slowly. "My boy saw them. Said the sky was green and red, like the northern lights. Took some videos on his phone." He laughed bitterly. "Well, he did."

Tom looked at his wife, and in that moment, thirty-five years of shared experience passed between them in a glance. The camping trips. The power outages during storms. The pandemic, when they'd learned to ration and wait and make do.

"We need to check on the kids," Sarah said.

Their children—now adults—were scattered. Emily in California, Michael in Colorado, Jessica just two hours away in Chicago. Two hours by car.

An eternity on foot.
