**December 2027 — March 2028**

*Part I: The Last of Everything*

The supermarkets were picked clean by October.

Jessica had watched it happen—first the run on water and batteries, then canned goods, then anything edible, then anything at all. By the time she reached Indianapolis, the grocery stores were hollow shells, their shelves bare, their parking lots empty except for abandoned shopping carts and the occasional body no one had bothered to move.

But that was okay, people said. There was still food in houses. In pantries. In basements. The suburbs were full of food—three months of supplies, six months if you rationed carefully.

By December, everyone understood the mathematics of doom.

Three hundred million Americans. Maybe half still alive after the first chaotic months. A hundred and fifty million mouths. Each mouth needing roughly two thousand calories per day. That was three hundred billion calories. Per day. For one country.

And the supply was exactly what had been in warehouses and homes on September 2nd. Nothing new was being produced. Nothing was being transported. The combines sat dead in fields of rotting grain. The food processing plants were silent. The trucks that once moved forty thousand pounds of food per load sat immobile on highways across the continent.

The math didn't work. It had never worked. Everyone had known this, in some abstract way, since the first week. But knowing and feeling your stomach eat itself are different things.

The first cold night came in early November.

Jessica woke at 3 AM, shivering so hard her teeth chattered. The furnace was dead—had been dead for months. They had blankets, layers, each other's body heat. But the temperature inside the Mitchell house was forty-two degrees, and it was only going to get colder.

"We need to burn something," her father said the next morning.

They burned books first. Not the sentimental ones—those they kept—but the paperback mysteries, the outdated textbooks, the magazines nobody had read in years. The fireplace, unused for a decade except for decorative purposes, became the center of the house. Everyone slept in the living room now, bodies arranged in a semicircle around the hearth.

Then they burned furniture. The chairs from the dining room nobody used. The desk from the home office. The bed frame from the guest room. Each piece bought them a few more hours of warmth.

"How long can we keep this?" Jessica asked.

Her father looked at the dwindling pile of combustibles. "Maybe February. Maybe March if we're careful."

"And then?"

He didn't answer.

*Part II: The Silence*

The Hendersons stopped answering their door in mid-December.

Jessica had been bringing them a portion of the communal soup—a thin broth made from whatever vegetables remained, stretched further each day. Mrs. Henderson was diabetic. Without insulin, everyone knew it was only a matter of time. But she had been managing, somehow, with careful diet and rationing.

The day the door stayed closed, Jessica knew.

She stood on the porch for a long time, soup container in her hands, staring at the holiday wreath still hanging from the knocker. Someone had put it up in the first days after the Event, perhaps hoping for normalcy, perhaps unable to accept that Christmas would be different this year.

She knocked again. Nothing.

"Should we...?" Michael had come up behind her.

"No." Jessica's voice was flat. "Not yet. Tomorrow, maybe."

They never went in. None of the neighbors did. The Henderson house joined the growing number of silent homes on the street—houses where the smoke had stopped rising from improvised chimneys, where no footprints marked the snow outside, where the only movement was the occasional scavenging animal or desperate human looking for anything left behind.

By January, half the houses on their block were tombs.

They didn't call them that, of course. They called them "empty" or "cleared" or "available for salvage." But everyone knew. The air itself seemed to carry the knowledge—a particular quality of stillness, of finality, that settled over neighborhoods where too many people had simply... stopped.

*Part III: The Arithmetic of Survival*

The community meetings became brutal.

They gathered in the Mitchell living room—now the de facto community center for their block—and counted. Counted calories. Counted people. Counted days until spring.

"We have approximately eighty thousand calories remaining in combined storage," Jessica's father reported. His voice had taken on a quality she didn't recognize—mechanical, detached. The voice of a man doing math he didn't want to complete. "At survival rations—eleven hundred calories per person per day—that gives us..."

He paused. Everyone in the room leaned forward.

"Thirty-one days. If we maintain current population."

Current population was twenty-three people. It had been thirty-eight in October.

"What about the Kowalski place?" someone asked. "They had a whole basement full of—"

"Already counted. Already distributed."

"The Morton house? They're... they're not using it anymore."

"Counted."

Silence. The fire crackled. Outside, snow was falling—the fourth significant snowfall of the month, beautiful and deadly.

"What are you saying, Tom?" Sarah Mitchell's voice was barely a whisper. "What exactly are you saying?"

"I'm saying the math doesn't work. There are too many of us. There isn't enough food." He looked around the room, meeting each pair of eyes in turn. "Someone needs to say it out loud. The weakest won't survive until spring. Some of us are going to die no matter what we do. The question is whether we let nature decide, or..."

"Or what?" Jessica's voice was sharp. "You're not suggesting we—"

"I'm not suggesting anything." Her father's composure cracked, just for a moment. "I'm stating facts. That's all I can do anymore. State the facts and let everyone make their own choices."

That night, three families announced they were leaving. They would take their share of the remaining food and try to reach relatives in the countryside—farms, rural properties, anywhere that might have more resources.

No one tried to stop them. Everyone knew the journey would probably kill them. Everyone also knew that staying might kill them too.

The math didn't care about feelings. The math only cared about calories and days and the finite nature of both.

*Part IV: The Long Dark*

January was the worst.

The temperatures dropped below zero for five straight days. The snow piled up until walking anywhere required exhausting effort. And the food—the precious, counted, rationed food—dwindled toward nothing.

They ate things they would never have considered before. The ornamental koi from the pond in the backyard, frozen solid and defrosted over the fire. The squirrels stupid enough to venture near their traps. The roots from plants in the garden, dug from the frozen earth with bleeding fingers.

When that wasn't enough, they ate the leather. Belts first, then shoes, then jackets. Boiled for hours, they provided something—mostly psychological, but calories too, probably. Maybe. It was something to chew, something to swallow, something to fill the howling emptiness.

Jessica lost twenty pounds in six weeks. She could count her ribs. Her hair started falling out in clumps—she found it on her pillow every morning, dark strands against the white cotton. Her period stopped, which was a blessing given the lack of supplies, and also terrifying in what it meant about her body shutting down non-essential functions.

But she was still alive. That was the thing that surprised her, every single morning. She woke up, and she was still alive, and she kept waking up, and eventually the surprise faded into a grim expectation that she would continue to do so.

Some people did not wake up.

Old Mr. Patterson, who had seemed so strong in the early days, organizing work parties and maintaining morale, simply didn't get up one morning. His wife found him cold in their shared sleeping space, peaceful, as if he had just decided that continuing wasn't worth the effort.

The Sullivan baby—four months old on the day of the Event—lasted until January 12th. There simply wasn't enough for nursing mothers to maintain their milk. Formula had run out weeks ago. The parents tried everything—goat's milk from the Harrisons' surviving goat, improvised substitutes, desperate measures. None of it worked. The funeral was small and silent, and the mother didn't speak again for the rest of the winter.

Others chose differently. The Dalton boy, sixteen years old, walked out into a blizzard on January 20th and never came back. His father said he'd gone to check the traps. Everyone knew there were no traps in that direction.

They didn't talk about it. There was nothing to say. The winter took who it took, by whatever method it chose, and the survivors kept surviving because that was the only other option.

*Part V: The First Signs*

February brought hope, and hope was almost worse than despair.

The days grew longer. The sun, when it appeared, had a warmth to it that hadn't been there before. The snow began to melt in patches, revealing the dead brown grass beneath.

And the food was almost gone.

"Three more weeks," Jessica's father said at the meeting. "If we cut rations again."

"Any more cuts and we won't have the strength to do anything," someone replied. "We're already barely functional."

"The earth is thawing. We can start planting in maybe six weeks. Early crops—radishes, lettuce—could be ready in eight or nine weeks from planting."

"That's nine weeks from now. We have food for three."

The silence stretched. Everyone knew what wasn't being said. Six weeks of no food. Six weeks of watching the sprouts grow while their bodies consumed themselves. Six weeks of deciding who deserved the last calories.

"We're not going to make it," someone said quietly. "Are we?"

Jessica looked around the room. Twenty-three people had become seventeen. Seventeen would become... how many? Who would be alive in April to see the first harvest?

She thought about the Henderson house, dark and cold. The Kowalski place. The Morton home. The Sullivan apartment with the empty crib they hadn't been able to look at since January.

Was this how it would be? The houses falling silent one by one until there was no one left? Until theirs was just another tomb on a street of tombs, in a city of tombs, a country of tombs?

"We'll forage," she heard herself say. "There are things growing already. Dandelion greens coming up. Some roots. It won't be enough, but it'll extend what we have."

"You know how to identify edible wild plants?"

"I learned. There was a book at the library." She didn't mention the other books she'd found there—the ones about the pioneer winters, about the Donner Party, about what humans had done when the food ran out entirely. "I can teach others."

It wasn't a solution. It was a delay. But delays were all they had now. Buying time, one meal at a time, until the earth decided to start producing again.

If enough of them could stay alive that long.

If any of them could stay alive that long.

*Part VI: The Count*

Spring came to Indianapolis on March 15th, 2028.

Jessica stood in the community garden—really just a collection of backyard plots that had been combined and extended—and watched the first true green shoots pushing through the soil. Peas. Radishes. The earliest, hardiest crops, planted the moment the ground was workable.

They had made it.

Not all of them. Of the thirty-eight people who had formed the neighborhood survival group in October, eleven remained. Eleven people, standing in a garden, watching vegetables grow.

Sixty percent mortality. The Great Filter, one of the ham radio contacts had called it. The line that separates the societies that survive from those that don't.

Jessica thought about the winter. About the silent houses. About the bodies they had buried—when they could dig—or left in the frozen ground until spring. About the choices they had made and the choices they had refused to make. About the weight she had lost and the hair that was only now starting to grow back. About the look in her mother's eyes when she realized her daughter was going to live after all.

"We should plant more," her father said. He was thin as a rail, his clothes hanging off him like sacks, but his voice had some of its old strength. "Every square foot. Every available plot. We can't go through that again."

"No," Jessica agreed. "We can't."

They worked through the morning, planting seeds, planning rows, calculating yields. The math was different now. Not the math of dying, but the math of living. How many calories they could grow. How much they could preserve for next winter. How to never, ever be that hungry again.

The sun was warm on her back. Real warmth, not just the memory of it. Somewhere in the distance, a bird was singing—the first birdsong she'd heard in months.

She wanted to feel happy. She wanted to feel grateful. Instead, she felt hollow—scraped out, emptied of everything except the grim determination that had gotten her through the dark months.

The houses around them were still mostly silent. Some would be reoccupied—survivors from other neighborhoods, refugees from the cities. Others would stand empty for years, monuments to the people who hadn't made it through.

The Great Filter had done its work. Those who remained had passed through to the other side.

Now they had to build a world worth surviving in.
