### The Schism

> *From the testimony of Sister Miriam, formerly of the Children of the Sun. Recorded by Haven historians, 2045.*

> *"Brother Ash wasn't wrong. That was the hardest part. He wasn't wrong about why the world burned. He was only wrong about what we should do with the ashes."*

**Spring 2030 — Blue Ridge Mountains, Virginia**

The argument had been building for months.

Seraphina stood at the edge of the amphitheater, watching the sun sink below the granite cliffs. Behind her, sixty-three Children of the Sun waited in uneasy silence. Before her, a young man with ash-gray eyes and a burned scar running from his left ear to his jaw stood rigid with fury.

"You've betrayed the revelation," Brother Ash said. His voice was quiet, but it carried.

"I've interpreted it," Seraphina replied. "As I always have."

"You've *compromised* it." He gestured toward the valley below, where a thin line of smoke rose from a distant farmhouse. "You break bread with the Machine-builders. You share fires with the priest who worships a dead god. You talk of *integration*."

"I talk of survival. Of reaching people where they are—"

"The Sun reached them where they were." Ash's voice rose. "It reached them in their offices and their cars and their *screens*. It burned through their false light and showed them the true one. And now you want to... what? Make peace with the old ways? Let them rebuild the cage?"

Seraphina felt the weight of every eye in the amphitheater. She had led these people for two years. Had given them meaning when meaning seemed lost. Had taught them to see the Event not as catastrophe but as liberation.

But meaning, she was learning, had a way of growing teeth.

"The Sun is not a sword, Ash. It is a teacher."

"The Sun is a *refiner*." He stepped closer. In the dying light, his scar seemed to glow. "Fire purifies, Seraphina. It does not negotiate. You cannot have purity through half-measures. You cannot worship the light while tolerating the darkness."

"And what would you have us do? Attack Haven? Burn their generators?"

The pause before his answer was too long. Too considered.

"If necessary," he said.

A murmur rippled through the congregation. Some voices of alarm. Others—and this chilled Seraphina more than anything—of agreement.

Brother Ash had arrived eighteen months earlier, half-dead from a journey he never fully explained. He'd been an engineering student at Virginia Tech before the Event. Twenty years old. Home for the weekend when the sky caught fire and the campus went dark.

His family hadn't survived the first winter. He didn't talk about how.

What he talked about, with a convert's fervor, was meaning.

"The CME wasn't random," he would say, sitting by the evening fire, his eyes reflecting the flames. "Look at what it destroyed. Not rocks. Not trees. Not rivers. *Technology*. The infrastructure of human arrogance. The systems we built to lift ourselves above the natural order."

"The damage was proportional to our dependence," agreed a former electrician named Ruth. "The most 'advanced' places fell the hardest."

"Because they were the most *corrupted*." Ash's voice was hypnotic. "We turned silicon into gods. We worshipped at altars of glass and copper. And the Sun—the *true* light—could not abide it anymore."

Seraphina had listened with the tolerance she showed to all theological positions within her flock. The Children of the Sun had always been a broad church—some believed in literal solar consciousness, others saw the sun as metaphor for natural law, still others simply needed a narrative that made their suffering purposeful.

But Ash was different. Ash had a system. And systems, unlike feelings, could be organized.

Over the following months, he had gathered the hardest believers. The ones who had lost the most. The ones for whom *almost* making peace with the old world was not enough.

"He speaks to the wounded ones," warned Elias, the elder who had welcomed Maya's caravan two years before. "The ones who cannot forgive."

"Forgive what?"

"Themselves. For surviving. For adapting. They need someone to blame, Seraphina. You gave them the Machine to blame. Ash is giving them the Machine-*builders*."

The final break came on the spring equinox.

Seraphina had announced that she would travel to Haven for the summer council—to represent the Children of the Sun in discussions about trade routes and mutual aid. It was a diplomatic mission, a gesture of goodwill.

To Ash, it was apostasy.

"You would sit with them," he said, before the full congregation. "Share tables with the men who rebuild the wires. Break bread with the woman who stares at the Sun through glass and calls it *physics*."

"Maya Chen is not our enemy."

"Maya Chen is building a *telescope*. A machine to spy on the face of God. And you would call her friend?"

"I would call her *neighbor*."

Ash shook his head slowly. "Then we are no longer family."

He turned to the congregation. In the torchlight, his face was a mask of terrible conviction.

"Those who believe as I believe—that the Sun's judgment was complete, that our only duty is to prevent the rebuilding of the cage—come with me. We will find a place apart. A place of true faith."

Twenty-three people rose.

Among them were some of the strongest workers, the fiercest believers. Ruth. A former marine named Cole. A young mother with a baby on her hip, her eyes blazing with something that looked like relief.

Seraphina watched them go.

"You're not going to stop them?" Elias asked quietly.

"How could I? They believe what I taught them. They just... believe it more."

"More purely."

"Yes." She closed her eyes. The torchlight danced on her lids, red and gold. "That's always the danger, isn't it? Someone always believes more purely."

Over the following months, word drifted back.

Ash's splinter group called themselves the *True Children of the Sun*. They had settled in an abandoned fire lookout tower in the Shenandoah, visible for miles. They had painted the tower gold.

They preached a simple gospel: The CME was a warning. A first strike. If humanity rebuilt its machines, a second—final—punishment would follow. The only safety was in simplicity. The only virtue was refusal.

"It's not entirely wrong, is it?" Maya said when she heard the reports. She and Seraphina were sitting in Maya's cramped office at the Haven observatory—a converted barn with a hole cut in the roof for the telescope. "The CME *was* caused by our dependence on technology. Not morally—the sun doesn't care about morals—but practically. A pre-industrial society would have barely noticed."

"So you agree with him?"

"I agree with his diagnosis. Not his prescription." Maya adjusted the lens on her worktable. "The sun will flare again. Maybe in fifty years, maybe in five hundred. It doesn't matter what we build or don't build. When it happens, either we'll be ready, or we won't. Refusing to prepare isn't faith. It's suicide dressed up as piety."

Seraphina was quiet for a long moment.

"He burned his own books, you know. Before he left. Technical manuals, textbooks, anything that explained how the old machines worked. He called it 'preventing temptation.'"

"And his followers?"

"They burned theirs too." Seraphina stared at the telescope—the machine for spying on God. "Ruth burned her grandfather's copy of *The Joy of Cooking*. Said it had too many recipes for electric ovens."

Maya didn't laugh. She had seen what fear could do to reason.

"What do you think he'll do?"

"Preach. Gather followers. Wait for us to prove him right by building something that fails." Seraphina rose and walked to the window. The sun was setting, painting the fields gold. "The tragedy is, he might be waiting a long time. Or no time at all. The sun doesn't care about our schedules any more than it cares about our faith."

She turned back to Maya.

"Watch him. Watch the wires, when Elias strings them. If Ash truly believes what he preaches, he won't let the Machine rebuild itself without a fight."

"You think he'll attack?"

"I think he'll feel *compelled* to. That's what purity does. It can't coexist with compromise. It has to cleanse." Seraphina's eyes were ancient, tired. "I taught him that. I just didn't teach him where to stop."

She left the observatory as the last light faded.

Maya sat in the darkness for a long time, thinking about fire.
