Dr. Maya Chen had not slept.

She had spent the night in her basement, the place she'd prepared for exactly this scenario—much to the amusement of her colleagues, who had called her "Doomsday Maya" behind her back. Bottled water. Canned food. A hand-crank radio that received nothing but static now. A generator that wouldn't start because the solar event had been so powerful it had fried even circuits that weren't connected to the grid.

That last part she hadn't anticipated. The Carrington Event of 1859 had set telegraph wires on fire, but the world had run on steam and muscle then. The models had suggested that a modern equivalent would destroy the power grid, fry exposed electronics, create massive transformer explosions across every continent.

But this was worse. Far worse.

The CME that hit Earth on September 2, 2027, wasn't just a Carrington-level event. It was the kind of solar storm that happened once every thousand years. The kind that geological records hinted at but no living human had ever witnessed. The geomagnetic disturbance was so intense that it had induced currents in conductors everywhere—inside the Earth, in every wire, in the delicate circuits of every electronic device, shielded or not.

She had spent the sleepless night doing the calculations in her head, and the numbers were catastrophic. A billion tons of magnetized plasma, traveling at nearly one percent the speed of light, had slammed into Earth's magnetic field and compressed it like a fist crushing a soap bubble. The resulting geomagnetic storm had induced electric currents in every conductor on the planet—power lines, phone cables, even the wiring inside walls. Transformers across the globe had exploded simultaneously, their copper windings turned into weapons by the very physics they relied on.

But that was only half the story—the half everyone had predicted.

The truly devastating part was what happened to the semiconductors. Modern electronics relied on transistors measured in nanometers—structures so small that a single energetic particle could flip a bit, corrupt a memory cell, fuse a junction. The storm had bombarded every chip on Earth with a radiation flux a thousand times beyond what they were designed to survive. Not just overwhelmed—physically destroyed. The delicate microscopic pathways etched into silicon had been burned out like fuses, their electrons ripped free and scattered by the electromagnetic onslaught.

This was why shielded electronics had failed. This was why backup systems had died. This was why even devices sitting disconnected in drawers and closets were now paperweights. The radiation had passed through walls, through Faraday cages, through military-grade hardening. It had been too intense, too sustained. The X-ray and gamma-ray burst accompanying the CME had ionized the upper atmosphere for hours, creating currents that coupled into everything, everywhere.

Cars had stopped working because their engine control units—dozens of microprocessors per vehicle—were fried beyond repair. Planes had fallen from the sky, their fly-by-wire systems dead, their pilots suddenly commanding nothing but dead weight. Hospitals had lost not just power but the ability to ever restore it; MRI machines, CT scanners, even simple digital thermometers were now archaeological artifacts of a dead civilization.

The supply chain for microchips—already strained by decades of consolidation—had been obliterated. The factories in Taiwan, South Korea, and China that produced 90% of the world's semiconductors had been destroyed along with everything else. Even if they hadn't been, the precision equipment needed to manufacture new chips was itself full of chips. It was turtles all the way down. To rebuild would require rebuilding, which would require rebuilding first.

Maya had stepped outside at first light to find a world that looked deceptively normal. Trees swayed. Clouds drifted. But the smoke rising in the distance—from transformer stations, from buildings with electrical fires—told a different story.

A neighbor she vaguely recognized stumbled toward her. Middle-aged man, still in his sleep clothes, face twisted in a kind of bewildered anguish.

"Do you know what's happening? My wife—her pacemaker—she—"

Maya felt the ground tilt beneath her feet. Of course. Pacemakers. Insulin pumps. Ventilators in hospitals. Every person whose life depended on a tiny electrical device—

"I'm sorry," she said, and she meant it for everything. For all of it. For not shouting louder, for not making people listen, for not finding a way to prepare a civilization for something it was culturally incapable of comprehending.

"Do you know what's happening?" he asked again.

Maya looked at the sky, still faintly tinged with auroral color even in daylight.

"The sun," she said. "A solar storm hit us last night. The biggest in recorded history. Everything electronic—transformers, cars, phones, computers—everything is fried. The power grid is gone. Not damaged. Gone."

"When will it come back?"

She wanted to lie. She wanted to offer hope. That's what you were supposed to do in moments like these.

"Years," she said. "Maybe decades. The infrastructure to rebuild... it depends on things that don't exist anymore. Manufacturing. Transportation. Global supply chains." She paused. "I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."

The man stared at her, and she watched the understanding seep into his face like water into sand. Not understanding of the technical details—understanding of what it meant. What it really meant.

"My wife," he said again.

"I'm sorry."

He walked away, directionless, a ghost before he became one.

Maya went back inside to check her supplies. To make plans. To do what scientists do in the face of catastrophe—observe, analyze, adapt.

Behind her, the world began to unravel.
