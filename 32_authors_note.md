## Author's Note

The Carrington Event of 1859 was a real solar storm that caused widespread disruption to telegraph systems worldwide. Modern civilization, with its dependence on electronic systems and interconnected power grids, is significantly more vulnerable to such events than the world of 1859.

This novel imagines a worst-case scenario—a solar storm far more powerful than the historical event—and explores how human communities might respond. The science is speculative but grounded in real discussions among space weather researchers about the potential impacts of extreme solar activity.

The characters in this story represent the range of human responses to catastrophe: the scientists who understand but cannot prevent, the ordinary people who must simply survive, the leaders who emerge from chaos, and the communities that form when old structures collapse. Arjun Sharma's journey—from tech professional in Mumbai to community organizer in Dharavi—represents a particularly Indian response to crisis: the turn toward collective action, traditional knowledge, and the improvisational resilience known as *jugaad*.

Above all, this is a story about resilience. About the human capacity to adapt, to help one another, and to build something new from ruins. It is also a story about humility—about learning that the old ways often carry wisdom we have forgotten, and that the most important connections are not digital but human.

The sun will continue to cycle through periods of greater and lesser activity. Extreme solar events will occur. The question is not if, but when—and whether we will be ready.
