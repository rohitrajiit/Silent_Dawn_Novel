### The Reckoning

> *From the Minutes of the Haven Community Council. Special Session, April 3, 2032.*
>
> *"Motion to authorize punitive action against the True Children of the Sun—TABLED pending outcome of diplomatic outreach. Vote: 7-5-2. Dissent noted by Councilor Torres."*

**April 3, 2032 — Haven, Tennessee**

The council chamber was standing room only.

Grace had called the emergency session three days after the news from Indiana reached Haven. The Scrapyard Academy. Daniel Miller. The letter from Brother Ash. Every detail had spread through the community like fire through dry grass.

Now the question was what to do about it.

"We've been patient," Samuel Torres said. He stood at the center of the circle, his voice controlled but carrying an edge that hadn't been there before. "For two years, we've watched these fanatics grow. We've watched them cut telegraph wires. We've watched them threaten communities that dared to rebuild. And now—" He held up the letter. "Now they've murdered a seventeen-year-old boy and *boasted* about it."

He set the letter on the table.

"We know where they camp. We know their numbers—maybe thirty, forty at most. The Republic militia could end this in a week. We could end it *tonight* if Haven committed our security force."

"And start what?" Grace asked. Her voice was quiet, but the room fell silent. "A civil war? Over religion?"

"Over *murder*, Grace."

"Daniel died in Indiana. That's Republic jurisdiction. If they want to mount an expedition—"

"They do. General Reeves is waiting for our support. For moral authority from the community that preached reconciliation for two years." Torres's jaw tightened. "You brought Father Miguel in. You had Seraphina at Christmas mass. You told everyone that the Children of the Sun could be *reasoned with*. And all that patience, all that bridge-building—it bought us a dead child and a cult that thinks it can kill with impunity."

The silence stretched.

Maya Chen rose from her seat near the back.

"Samuel is right about one thing," she said. "We've been patient. And patience hasn't worked—not with Brother Ash's faction. They've radicalized beyond reason. They believe, genuinely believe, that they're doing God's work."

"So you agree we should hunt them down?"

"No." Maya walked forward. "But I don't think we should do *nothing*, either."

She stopped beside the table where the letter lay.

"Brother Ash believes the sun is a conscious entity. That it punished humanity for building technology. That rebuilding invites a second, final judgment." She looked around the room. "He's not entirely wrong."

A murmur of surprise.

"The CME *was* caused by our dependence on technology. Not morally—the sun doesn't have morals—but practically. A society without electronics would have barely noticed the Event. Our infrastructure collapsed because we had built it to collapse. That's not divine punishment; it's engineering failure. But to someone who lost everything, who watched their family die, who needed someone to *blame*—the difference is subtle."

"What are you proposing?" Grace asked.

"Invite him here. To the observatory. Let me show him what the sun actually is."

Torres laughed—a short, incredulous sound. "You want to give a *science lesson* to the man who burned down a school?"

"I want to show him that his entire theology is based on a misunderstanding. The sun will flare again—in fifty years, in five hundred, whenever. It doesn't matter what we build or don't build. The next CME isn't punishment; it's weather. Stellar weather, on a scale we can barely comprehend, but weather nonetheless."

"And you think that will convince him?"

"I think..." Maya paused. "I think probably not. But I think we have to try. Because if we don't—if we skip straight to violence—then we're not the people we claimed to be. We're just another faction fighting for power."

"We're fighting for *survival*," Torres said.

"We're fighting to be worth surviving for." Maya's voice was sharp. "What are we rebuilding, Samuel? Just infrastructure? Just wires and generators and grain stores? Or something more? Something that justifies all the death?"

She looked at the council.

"I'm not naive. If Brother Ash refuses to come—if he responds with more violence—then I'll vote for the expedition myself. But we're not there yet. We're at the moment where we decide what kind of world we're making. And I want it to be a world that tries persuasion before punishment. Even when persuasion seems hopeless."

The debate went on for hours.

Grace spoke of the fragile peace they had built, of the communities that had chosen Haven as a model because it *didn't* rule by force. Torres spoke of deterrence, of the message sent by inaction, of the next attack that would come if this one went unanswered.

Father Miguel, old now and rarely speaking in council, rose near the end.

"I spent my life teaching that God works through human choices," he said. "That we are the instruments of grace—or the instruments of wrath. What we do here will echo for generations. Not because the world is watching, but because *we* are watching. We will become what we choose tonight."

He sat down.

The vote was called.

Seven in favor of Maya's approach. Five for Torres's expedition. Two abstentions.

Torres stood, his face unreadable.

"You're making a mistake," he said. "And Daniel Miller won't be the last to pay for it."

He walked out.

**April 10, 2032 — The Observatory, Haven**

The letter was sent by messenger to the last known camp of the True Children.

It was simple:

*Brother Ash—*

*You believe the sun judges us. I believe it doesn't. I have a telescope that can show you what the sun actually is: a ball of hydrogen and plasma, beautiful and violent and utterly indifferent to human behavior.*

*Come to Haven. Look through the lens. See for yourself.*

*If I'm wrong, I'll admit it. If I'm right—perhaps you'll reconsider.*

*Either way, no one will harm you. You have my word, and the word of the Haven Council.*

*— Dr. Maya Chen*

The messenger returned a week later with the response:

*I will come. Not because your glass and metal can show me truth—the Sun reveals truth on its own terms. I will come because I want you to see what you refuse to see: that even your instruments are instruments of pride, and pride is the root of all this burning.*

*One question first: do you know why Daniel Miller died?*

*Because he loved the Machine more than he loved the light.*

*— Brother Ash*

Maya read the letter three times.

Then she began to prepare.
