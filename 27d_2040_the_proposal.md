### The Proposal

> *Letter from Arjun Sharma to Dr. Maya Chen. Dated March 2040. Carried by the ship "Sagarmatha" from Mumbai to Charleston.*
>
> *"Dear Maya, I write to you with an idea that may seem foolish in its ambition but necessary in its essence. What if we stopped just exchanging letters, and started exchanging people?"*

**March 2040 — Dharavi, Mumbai**

Arjun Sharma was forty-seven years old when he finally understood what Kamala-mausi had been trying to teach him.

It happened on an ordinary morning—the kind that had become routine in the thirteen years since the Event. He was teaching the advanced class at the Institute: twenty young people, born in the late chaos or the early recovery, learning mathematics and science and history from handwritten textbooks and salvaged reference materials.

The lesson was about electricity. How it worked. Why it had failed. What would be needed to restore it someday.

A young woman in the front row—Sarita, seventeen, sharp as a blade—raised her hand.

"Sir, why would we want to restore it?"

The question surprised him. "What do you mean?"

"Electricity. The grid. All of it." Sarita's eyes were earnest, not challenging. "Everything we've read says the old world was... fragile. Dependent. People couldn't survive without machines. Why would we want to go back to that?"

Arjun opened his mouth to answer—and stopped. Because he didn't have one. At least, not one that felt true.

"That's an excellent question," he said slowly. "Class dismissed for today. I need to think."

He walked through Dharavi, through the lanes that had become as familiar as his own heartbeat. Thirteen years. Thirteen years since he had stumbled into this place, a useless tech worker with no practical skills, and found Kamala-mausi waiting with a cup of chai and a lesson he hadn't known he needed.

She had been dead for twelve years now. Cholera, during the first monsoon crisis. He still visited her grave every Sunday, still talked to her as if she could hear.

"Mausi," he said aloud, standing at the simple stone marker. "A student asked me today why we should restore the old world. And I didn't know what to say."

The grave, as always, offered no response.

"The thing is... she's right, isn't she? The old world was beautiful, but it was brittle. All that knowledge, all that power, and we couldn't survive without it. One solar flare and everything collapsed." He sat on the ground, cross-legged, the way he had sat with her in her tea stall. "Maybe we shouldn't be trying to rebuild what was. Maybe we should be building something different."

He thought about Maya Chen's letters. Thirteen years of correspondence now, carried on ships that took months to cross oceans. She wrote about solar monitoring, about early warning systems, about making sure this never happened again. He wrote about education, about knowledge preservation, about training the next generation to survive whatever came.

But they were both, he realized, thinking like survivors. Thinking about not dying. Not about living.

"What would you tell them, Mausi? The young ones who never knew the old world. What would you say was worth preserving?"

The answer came to him not as words, but as a memory: Kamala-mausi teaching him to filter water, patient and methodical, explaining not just how but why. Not just the technique but the principle. And then, when he had learned, sending him to teach someone else.

"Connection," he said aloud. "That's what you taught me. Not the knowledge itself—the sharing of it. The passing on."

He stood up, brushed the dirt from his clothes, and walked back to the Institute. He had a letter to write.

*Dear Maya,*

*A student asked me today why we should want to restore the old world. I've been thinking about it for hours, and I believe she's asking the wrong question.*

*The old world is gone. It's not coming back—not the way it was. Even if we rebuilt every power plant and every factory and every network, we would not recreate what existed before. The people who built it are mostly dead. The culture that sustained it is scattered. The assumptions it rested on—endless growth, instant communication, global supply chains—are no longer possible.*

*But that doesn't mean we should abandon the idea of connection. It means we should reimagine it.*

*Here is my proposal: a teacher exchange. Students from Mumbai traveling to Haven, students from Haven traveling to Mumbai. Not to study in isolation, but to live. To learn not just facts but perspectives. To understand that the way we rebuilt here is not the only way, that other communities found other solutions, that humanity is not one thing but many things.*

*You have spoken in your letters about the importance of solar monitoring. I agree. But I believe the more important monitoring is of each other. If we only know our own communities, we become insular. We forget that others exist. We make the same mistakes the old world made—assuming our way is the only way, becoming fragile in our certainty.*

*The exchange would be slow. Months of travel each way. Years spent in foreign places. But that slowness is the point. The old world's instant connections were shallow—information without understanding, communication without comprehension. What I am proposing is deep connection. The kind that changes you.*

*It would take years to organize. Decades to bear fruit. We might not live to see the full results. But isn't that what we're doing anyway? Building things we won't live to see completed?*

*Your friend,*
*Arjun*

The response came eight months later, on a ship from Charleston.

*Dear Arjun,*

*Yes.*

*That's my answer. Yes. A thousand times yes.*

*I've been thinking along similar lines but couldn't find the words. You found them. The exchange is the thing that matters—not the knowledge itself, but the sharing of it. Not the survival of information, but the survival of connection.*

*I am old now. Seventy-seven. My hands shake when I write these letters. I probably won't live to see the first exchange students arrive. But I can help plan the framework. I can use whatever influence I have to make this happen.*

*Here is what I propose: we begin with a pilot program. Two students from each side. Young people who are adaptable, curious, willing to spend years far from home. We fund the travel through community contributions—everyone giving a little so that a few can go far.*

*The students wouldn't just study. They would teach. Whatever they know that the host community doesn't, they would share. And whatever they learn, they would bring back. A chain of hands, passing knowledge.*

*You wrote that Kamala-mausi taught you this. I never met her, but I feel I know her through your letters. She understood something most of us forget: that knowledge isn't a possession. It's a relationship. It only exists when it moves between people.*

*Let's make it move between continents.*

*Your friend,*
*Maya*

The first exchange happened in 2045, five years later. Four students: two from Mumbai sailing west, two from Haven sailing east. Mira Chen—Maya's granddaughter—was among them. 

Arjun met the Haven students when their ship arrived in Mumbai Harbor. Twenty-three years old, both of them, wide-eyed and overwhelmed by a city unlike anything they had imagined.

"Dr. Sharma?" one of them said—a young man named Thomas, from Nashville. "Dr. Chen told us to find you. She said you would show us what connection really means."

Arjun smiled. "I'm not a doctor. And I don't know what connection really means. But I know someone who taught me how to find out."

He took them to Kamala-mausi's grave first, before anything else. He told them her story—the tea stall, the lessons, the monsoon crisis that took her. He told them that everything he knew, everything the Institute had become, grew from seeds she had planted.

"She never traveled," he said. "Never left Mumbai. But she understood something about the world that most travelers never learn: that everywhere you go, you find the same things. People trying to survive. People trying to help each other. People passing on what they know."

Thomas looked at the grave, then at the city sprawling around them, then back at Arjun.

"Why did she stay here, if she understood all that?"

"Because you don't have to travel to understand the world. You just have to pay attention." Arjun touched the gravestone. "But traveling helps. Seeing with your own eyes helps. That's why you're here. To see for yourself what we've built—and to help us see, through your eyes, what we might have missed."

He led them into the city, into the lanes of Dharavi, into the beginning of an exchange that would continue for decades. By the time he died, in 2057, there would be hundreds of alumni—students who had crossed oceans and returned, carrying knowledge like seeds, planting it in new soil.

Some things, it turned out, grew better when they traveled.
