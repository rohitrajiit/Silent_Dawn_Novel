**November 2028 — Indianapolis**

The second meeting of the Indianapolis Assembly drew even more representatives than the first.

This time, there was an agenda: the formal establishment of the Midwestern Republic.

"It sounds like Star Wars," Jessica whispered to her father.

"It sounds like survival," Tom Mitchell replied.

The debates were shorter this time—or they were supposed to be. The reality of the coming winter—the second winter—focused everyone's minds. They needed grain distribution protocols. They needed a common currency (grain credits, for now). They needed a defense pact against the raider bands that were becoming organized armies.

But Garrett Hollis had other ideas.

He rose during the discussion of emergency powers, his silver hair catching the light from the gymnasium's high windows. "Before we proceed to Article Four," he said, "I'd like to propose an amendment to the foundational structure."

Reeves, who was chairing the session, nodded cautiously. "Go ahead."

"We've all acknowledged that crisis situations require swift action. The Starving Time taught us that. The raider attacks have reinforced it. My question is simple: when the Republic faces a genuine emergency—an invasion, a plague, a crisis that threatens our collective survival—who decides?"

"The Council," someone called out. "That's what we just agreed."

"The Council. Nine people, scattered across hundreds of miles, connected by runners who might take days to deliver a message." Hollis shook his head. "By the time the Council convenes and reaches consensus, the emergency will have passed. One way or another."

"What are you proposing?" Jessica asked, already dreading the answer.

"An Emergency Chancellor provision. A single leader, empowered to make binding decisions during declared emergencies. Limited term—six months maximum, with Assembly review required to extend. Full authority over military deployment, resource allocation, and civil order."

The gymnasium erupted. Some in outrage, some in support. Jessica saw her father's face go pale.

"That's dictatorship," Tom Mitchell said, rising to his feet. "Temporary dictatorship is still dictatorship."

"Roman republic lasted five hundred years with exactly this provision," Hollis replied calmly. "They called it 'dictator'—not as an insult, but as an office. Cincinnatus served twice, saved Rome twice, and returned to his farm both times. The mechanism worked for half a millennium."

"Until it didn't. Until Caesar."

"Everything ends eventually, Mr. Mitchell. The question is whether it ends in collapse or transition." Hollis turned to address the full assembly. "I'm not asking to be Chancellor. I'm not asking for permanent power. I'm asking you to acknowledge a simple truth: democracy is slow. Deliberation takes time. And when time runs out, someone has to act. Better that someone be chosen in advance, with clear limits and accountability, than that they simply seize power in the chaos."

Jessica felt the room shifting. She saw heads nodding, saw the fear in people's eyes—not of Hollis, but of the next winter, the next attack, the next crisis that would find them unprepared.

"He's going to win this," she muttered to her father. "Look at them."

"He might."

Jessica stood. "May I speak?"

Reeves nodded.

"Mr. Hollis is right about one thing," Jessica said. "Crisis requires speed. I've seen what happens when decisions are delayed—people die. I walked through communities that fell apart because no one could agree on what to do." She paused, feeling the weight of what she was about to say. "But I've also seen what happens when one person has unchecked authority. The raider bands we're so afraid of? Most of them started as communities with strong leaders. Leaders who decided that their authority was more important than the people they were supposed to protect."

"I'm proposing checks," Hollis said. "Assembly review. Term limits—"

"Terms limits that you've already suggested can be extended. Assembly review that happens after the emergency is over—after the decisions have already been made." Jessica shook her head. "The power to declare an emergency is the power to rule. Once you give someone that authority, you're trusting them to give it back. History suggests that's not a safe bet."

"History also suggests that democracies fall to organized enemies while they're still debating what to do."

"Then we build better democracies. Faster ones. Ones with clear protocols for rapid response that don't require concentrating power in a single person." Jessica looked around the gymnasium. "The messenger runner network works because we distributed authority. Every community handles its own routes, its own schedules. We coordinate, but no one commands. It's efficient because it's resilient. Take out any single node, and the network keeps functioning."

"Defense isn't a postal service, Ms. Mitchell."

"No. But the principle is the same. Distribute authority. Build redundancy. Trust the people closest to the problem to handle it, with coordination rather than command." She sat down. "That's what I'm proposing. Not an Emergency Chancellor, but an Emergency Protocol. Pre-agreed responses to specific scenarios. If the raiders attack from the north, Militia District Three responds immediately, without waiting for Council approval. If grain supplies fall below threshold, rationing protocols activate automatically. Clear triggers, automatic responses, distributed execution."

The debate continued for another hour. When Reeves finally called for a vote on Hollis's amendment, Jessica held her breath.

The count was excruciatingly close. Thirty-three in favor. Thirty-three against. Eleven abstentions.

A tie.

The gymnasium fell silent. Everyone turned to look at Grace, who had been sitting in the back, watching the proceedings with the same unreadable expression she'd worn throughout the winter. She hadn't spoken during the debate. She hadn't needed to—her presence alone carried weight.

"A tie requires a resolution," Reeves said carefully. "Under our provisional rules, any member of the standing Council may break a tie. Grace?"

Grace stood slowly. She was smaller than most of the people in the room, worn down by months of impossible decisions, but when she spoke, her voice carried.

"I vote against."

Three words. The Emergency Chancellor provision died by a single vote—Grace's vote.

Hollis's face didn't change. He simply nodded once, as if confirming something he had already expected, and sat down.

Nearly half the assembly had been willing to create an Emergency Chancellor. Nearly half had looked at the evidence—the mortality rates, the delayed decisions, the cost of deliberation—and concluded that Garrett Hollis was right.

Reeves found Jessica during the afternoon recess. The Colonel was standing by a window, staring out at the grey November sky.

"That was closer than it should have been," Jessica said.

"Yes." Reeves didn't turn around. "I voted against it, you know. Surprised?"

"A little. You've been pushing for unified command since the first Assembly."

"Unified military command. Under civilian control. That's different from what Hollis was proposing." Reeves finally turned to face her. "I've spent my career in the military. I understand the appeal of clear hierarchy, decisive leadership, someone who can just make the call. But I've also seen what happens when that power gets institutionalized. The military works because we know we answer to civilians. Because the uniform comes off at the end of the day."

"And an Emergency Chancellor wouldn't answer to anyone."

"Not really. Not in the moment. All the checks and reviews happen afterward, when the emergency is over—and emergencies have a way of never quite being over." Reeves shook her head. "Rome's dictators worked because Roma culture expected them to step down. Our culture is television and conspiracy theories. I don't trust us to get the stepping-down part right."

"So we're safe?"

"For now. But that vote tells you something. Almost forty percent of this assembly—people who fought through the worst year of their lives—were willing to hand power to a single person. Because they're scared. Because they want someone to tell them everything will be okay." Reeves put a hand on Jessica's shoulder. "Your alternative was good. The distributed response protocols. Push that hard. Get it into the final structure. Because Hollis will be back. Or someone like him. And next time, they might win."

The structure they established was more elaborate than the Compact, but still designed for a world without mass communication or rapid transportation:

**The Assembly** would remain the supreme authority—representatives from every member community meeting twice yearly. Major decisions required a two-thirds vote.
**The Council** would handle affairs between Assembly sessions. Nine members, elected from regional districts, serving two-year terms. They could make emergency decisions, but the Assembly could override them.
**The Tribunals** would resolve disputes between communities. Three judges, appointed by the Assembly, serving five-year terms. Their decisions were binding unless overturned by Assembly vote.
**The Militia** would provide common defense. Each community contributed personnel proportionally. Command rotated among the largest communities. Deployment required Council approval, except in cases of immediate threat.

"It's messy," Colonel Reeves admitted during a break. "But democracy always is."

"Is it democracy?" Jessica asked. "Or is it feudalism with a committee?"

"It's a Republic of Necessity," Reeves said. "We do what we must to keep the lights on. Metaphorically speaking."

Reeves had aged ten years in the last one. Her uniform was clean but threadbare. She looked tired.

"We need to talk about communications, Jessica."

"The runner network is working. We have routes to Chicago, St. Louis, Cincinnati."

"It's working because you made it work. You and your sister's memory." Reeves looked at the map on the wall. "The Republic needs that. We need to integrate the network. Make it official. Give the runners protection, resources, priority."

"You want to nationalize the mail."

"All governments are fragile. The old ones just hid it better." Reeves turned to face her. "Your message runner network. The trade routes. The communication systems. Those are what make this possible. Without them, we're just isolated communities pretending to be united. With them, we have a chance at something real."

Jessica nodded. She had been so focused on practical problems—routes, schedules, personnel—that she hadn't thought about the larger implications. But Reeves was right. Information flow was the circulatory system of any society. Without it, nothing else could function.

"We should formalize it," she said. "The runner network. Make it part of the Republic's infrastructure."

"I was hoping you'd say that. The Council will need a Communications Director. Interested?"

It wasn't a question she had expected. But standing there, in the gymnasium where the Midwestern Republic had just been born, she realized she had already made her choice.

"Yes," she said. "I'm interested."
