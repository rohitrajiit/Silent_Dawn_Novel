### The Efficiency of Necessity

> *Internal Memorandum: Hollis Compound Resource Allocation. February 2028.*
>
> *"Mortality rate: 8.2%. Below projected threshold. Surplus grain: 2,400 lbs. Strategic recommendation: deploy surplus to acquire political capital in distressed communities. Investment ratio: 1 bushel = 1 vote."*

**February 2028 — Rural Ohio**

Garrett Hollis stood at the window of what had been his vacation home and was now the administrative center of humanity's most efficiently-run survivor community. Outside, the February snow was melting. Inside, he was doing math.

Three hundred and twelve people had entered his compound on September 2nd. Two hundred and eighty-seven remained. Twenty-five dead—most in the first chaotic weeks, a few to illness, two to accidents, one to suicide. Eight point two percent mortality.

He had the numbers from other communities now, gathered through careful reconnaissance. Haven, the settlement in Tennessee that everyone talked about: thirty-five percent. The Indianapolis collective: twenty-eight percent. The farming cooperative near Lafayette: forty-three percent before raiders finished them off.

Eight point two percent.

Some called him a monster for what he'd done to achieve that number. The mandatory work shifts. The caloric rationing based on productivity. The three families he'd exiled for refusing to follow protocols. Those families had died on the road—he'd confirmed it through scouts—and their deaths haunted his sleep.

But two hundred and eighty-seven people were alive because he'd made the hard calls no one else would make.

*Democracy*, he thought, watching a work crew clear snow from the solar panels he'd installed years ago as a hobby, *is a beautiful theory. But theories don't keep children alive through a Starving Winter.*

A knock at his door. Rebecca Marsh, his operations director—former hospital administrator, ruthlessly competent, one of the few people who understood what leadership actually required.

"The southern scouts are back," she said. "They found Haven."

"Condition?"

"Desperate. They're eating bark soup. Burning furniture for heat." Rebecca consulted her notes. "Estimated three weeks of food remaining. Maybe four if they cut rations again."

Garrett turned from the window. "How many people?"

"Approximately two hundred. Down from over three hundred in October."

He did the math instantly. A hundred dead in five months. Thirty-three percent mortality and climbing. "Do they have anything we need?"

"They have something better." Rebecca's expression was careful—the look she wore when she was about to propose something he might not like. "They have a leader everyone respects. Grace. Former social worker. She's built real community loyalty. And they have Jessica Mitchell, who's establishing a message runner network across the Midwest."

"Communications infrastructure." Garrett nodded slowly. "That's valuable."

"More valuable than grain, long-term. And right now, we have grain they need."

"You're suggesting we help them."

"I'm suggesting we invest in them." Rebecca set down her notes. "We have surplus. Twenty-four hundred pounds of grain we won't need before the spring harvest. We could use it to save our own people—but our people are already saved. Or we could use it to buy influence."

Garrett walked to the map on his wall—hand-drawn, updated weekly with intelligence from scouts. The eastern communities were collapsing. The southern ones were barely holding on. But the Midwest was stabilizing, and whoever shaped that stabilization would shape the next decade.

"Not just influence," he said. "Authority. If we help them now, with conditions, we become part of their decision-making structure. We don't just save lives—we ensure those lives are organized efficiently."

"What kind of conditions?"

"A seat on their Council. Veto power over resource allocation." He turned to face Rebecca. "They're making mistakes. Democratic mistakes. Debating rationing while people starve. Voting on who deserves medicine. That has to stop."

Rebecca was quiet for a moment. "Some of our people won't like this. They'll say we should keep the surplus for ourselves."

"Our people are alive because they followed my decisions. They'll follow this one too." Garrett pulled on his coat. "Prepare the wagons. I'll lead the convoy myself."

The journey to Haven took four days. Twelve wagons, loaded with grain, pulled by the horses they'd managed to keep alive through careful husbandry. Forty armed escorts—not because he expected trouble, but because it was important to arrive looking strong.

Garrett spent the travel time preparing his arguments. He'd negotiated billion-dollar mergers in his previous life. He'd restructured failing corporations, laid off thousands of workers, made the kinds of decisions that kept him up at night and kept companies alive. This was the same thing, scaled differently.

The math was simple: Haven was dying. He could save them. But salvation without structure was just delayed death. They would face another crisis—raiders, disease, drought—and they would make the same mistakes: debating when they should be acting, voting when they should be executing.

He wasn't cruel. He wasn't a tyrant. He was a man who understood systems, and he understood that democratic decision-making was a system optimized for stability, not survival.

*We're in triage*, he thought, watching the winter landscape pass. *You don't take votes in an emergency room.*

They arrived at Haven on a grey February morning. The settlement was smaller than he'd expected—a cluster of buildings around a former community center, fields that would be productive in spring, a perimeter fence that wouldn't stop a determined attack.

Grace met them at the gate. She was smaller than he'd imagined, with grey-streaked hair and the kind of exhausted calm that came from making impossible decisions for months on end. Behind her, he could see the gaunt faces of her people—survivors who had clearly pushed through the worst of the winter, but only barely.

"Garrett Hollis," she said. "I've heard of you."

"Nothing good, I imagine."

"Nothing simple." She looked past him at the wagons. "Is that what I think it is?"

"Twenty-four hundred pounds of grain. Enough to get you through to spring harvest. Enough to save the people you're going to lose in the next three weeks."

Grace's expression didn't change, but he saw the tension in her shoulders, the slight tremor in her hands. She knew the math too. "And the price?"

"Nothing you can't afford." Garrett stepped forward, lowering his voice. "A seat on your Council. Veto power over resource allocation decisions. My people integrated into your community as full members."

"Veto power."

"Only on resources. I'm not asking to run your community. I'm asking to prevent the mistakes that killed a third of your population while we lost eight percent."

Grace was silent for a long moment. Behind her, her people were staring at the wagons with the desperate hunger of people who had spent months watching their friends die.

"How many did you exile?" she asked quietly. "To get that eight percent?"

"Three families. Twelve people. They refused to follow rationing protocols. They hoarded food while others went hungry."

"And they died."

"Yes." Garrett met her eyes squarely. "And two hundred and eighty-seven people lived. That's the trade I made. That's the trade you're making now—my conditions for your survival."

Grace looked at him for a long moment. Then she turned and called out: "Open the gates. Bring the wagons in."

The negotiations took two days. Grace never agreed to everything he asked—she was shrewder than he'd expected, and she had allies on her Council who pushed back against his demands. In the end, he got the Council seat but not the veto. Instead, a provision: major resource decisions required a two-thirds majority, and as a Council member, he could block anything that fell short of that threshold.

It wasn't everything. But it was enough.

On the last night, before his convoy returned to Ohio, Grace found him standing outside the community center, watching the stars.

"You're not evil," she said. "I've met evil. You're something else."

"Efficient."

"Cold. There's a difference." She stood beside him, arms crossed against the chill. "I accepted your terms because people were dying. But I need you to understand something, Garrett. What you're offering isn't leadership. It's management."

"Is there a difference?"

"Leadership is getting people to want what you want. Management is getting them to do what you want whether they agree or not." Grace turned to face him. "You managed your compound through the winter. Congratulations. But you didn't build loyalty—you built compliance. The moment something better comes along, your people will leave."

"Something better hasn't come along."

"Not yet." She walked away, then paused at the door. "Thank you for the grain. My people will live because of it. But I'm going to spend the next ten years proving that your way isn't the only way."

Garrett watched her go. *Ten years*, he thought. *In ten years, we'll see whose methods produce results.*

He didn't know, standing there in the February cold, that Grace would be right about one thing: people did leave eventually. Not his generation—they were too grateful, too traumatized, too invested in the system that had kept them alive.

Their children were another matter entirely.

But that was a problem for the future. Tonight, he had accomplished exactly what he'd set out to accomplish: saved lives, acquired influence, and positioned himself to shape the rebuilding of civilization according to principles that actually worked.

*Democracy is a luxury for stable times*, he thought as he walked back to his convoy. *We are not stable. We may never be stable again.*

*And that's why they'll need me.*
