### The City Falls

**September 7, 2027 — Chicago**

The fires started on Day Four.

Not the scattered electrical fires that had plagued the first day—those had mostly burned themselves out. These were different. These were deliberate. These were the fires of frustration and fear and fury, set by people who watched their world collapse and found destruction easier than adaptation.

Marcus Washington watched from his apartment window as the building across the street went up in flames.

He had been a firefighter for eighteen years. Had saved lives and lost them, watched buildings fall and rise, seen the best and worst humanity had to offer in moments of crisis.

This was the worst.

The fire department—his brothers and sisters, his family—had responded to the first emergencies with characteristic courage. But the trucks that relied on modern ignition systems wouldn't start. The pumps that needed electricity to run sat silent. They had improvised, used older equipment, formed bucket brigades, done everything they could.

It wasn't enough. It was never going to be enough.

By Day Four, the department was in triage mode. They couldn't reach everything. They couldn't save everything. So they made choices. Hospitals first. Shelters. Critical infrastructure.

Apartment buildings like the one burning across the street... those were on their own.

Marcus watched as people streamed out of the building, some carrying belongings, some carrying children, some carrying nothing at all. He should be down there. He should be helping. But his shift had ended six hours ago, after thirty-six hours of continuous work, and his captain had ordered him home.

"Rest," Captain Williams had said. "We need you functional. This isn't a sprint. This is a marathon, and it's just getting started."

Marcus wasn't sure it was a marathon. Marathons had finish lines. This felt more like an endless fall into darkness.

His phone sat useless on his nightstand. He had battery-powered radio that crackled mostly static, occasionally picking up fragments of amateur broadcasts—people with old equipment, ham radio operators who suddenly found themselves the center of communication networks.

From what he could piece together, the situation was the same everywhere. Every city, every country. The entire global grid, fried. Satellites, gone. The International Space Station, silent—he tried not to think about the people up there, if they were still alive, if they could see the darkness spreading across Earth's night side.

A knock at his door. He approached carefully—trust was a endangered commodity these days—and looked through the peephole.

Mrs. Chen from down the hall. Seventy-two years old, lived alone, originally from Taiwan. She had brought him mooncakes every Autumn Festival since he'd moved into the building.

He opened the door. She stood there, small and dignified, holding a covered dish.

"I made soup," she said. "Too much for one person. Will you share?"

Marcus felt something shift in his chest. "Mrs. Chen, you should be saving your food. Things are going to get—"

"I know what things will get. I survived the White Terror, then the Cultural Revolution. I know about hard times." She lifted the dish slightly. "Soup is better shared. Always."

He let her in. They ate soup together while the building across the street burned. Mrs. Chen told him about Taiwan in the 1940s, about the chaos and fear and loss. About leaving everything behind, about starting over, about surviving.

"Humans are tougher than we think," she said. "We forget, in the comfortable times. We think we are soft. But the hardness is still there, underneath. You will see."

Marcus looked at this tiny woman who had survived more than he could imagine, who had crossed oceans and rebuilt her life multiple times, who responded to civilizational collapse by making soup.

"I hope you're right, Mrs. Chen."

"I am always right," she said. "Ask my son. He will tell you."

A ghost of a smile touched Marcus's face. "Where is your son?"

The lightness faded from her eyes. "San Francisco. His wife, my grandchildren... I don't know."

Marcus understood. Thousands of miles. Mountains and deserts and desperate people in between. 

"I'm sorry."

"Me too." She began collecting the dishes. "But tomorrow, I will make more soup. And the day after. We keep going. That's what humans do."

After she left, Marcus sat in the dark and listened to the city burn. He thought about his own family—his mother in Detroit, his sister in Atlanta. He thought about the wedding he was supposed to attend next month. He thought about the future that had been a predictable trajectory and was now a blank void.

Then he stood, put on his gear, and went back out into the night. There was work to do.
