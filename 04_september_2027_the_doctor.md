Dr. David Okonkwo had performed surgery by candlelight once before—during his residency in Lagos, after a generator had failed during a procedure. He had thought that would be the strangest emergency of his career.

He had been wrong.

The emergency room at Piedmont Hospital was a scene from a different century. No monitors. No ventilators. No imaging equipment. Just exhausted medical staff, dwindling supplies, and a tide of patients that hadn't stopped since dawn.

The first wave had been the obvious casualties: people with pacemakers that had stopped, diabetics whose insulin pumps had failed, patients on home dialysis who had no way to continue treatment. Then came the car accidents—the newer vehicles had simply stopped in the middle of highways, causing pileups and chaos. Then the fires—electrical fires from surging systems, house fires when people tried to cook over open flames indoors.

And now, a new category: violence.

A man on a gurney in front of David had been stabbed over a generator. The generator didn't work, of course, but the attacker hadn't known that. The man was going into shock, and David had no way to transfuse blood—the refrigeration had failed, the blood bank's inventory was already warming past the point of safety.

"Pressure on the wound," he told the nurse beside him. "And pray."

The nurse—a veteran named Gloria who had seen everything in her thirty years at Piedmont—met his eyes. They didn't pray. Not professionally. But they understood each other.

The hospital had perhaps a day's worth of diesel for the backup generators, which powered only the most critical areas. After that, they would be working by sunlight and candlelight. Surgeries by hand. Diagnoses by touch and intuition rather than imaging and bloodwork.

The full scope of the loss was almost impossible to comprehend. The MRI machines—those magnetic marvels that could peer inside human bodies—were useless, their superconducting magnets quenched, their computers dead. The CT scanners, the X-ray machines, the ultrasound equipment—all required electricity and functional circuits, and had neither. Blood chemistry analyzers that could diagnose diseases in minutes were now plastic boxes with burned-out boards. The pharmacy's refrigeration had failed; insulin was spoiling, vaccines degrading, temperature-sensitive medications becoming poison.

Even the simple tools had been compromised. Digital thermometers, electronic blood pressure monitors, glucometers for diabetics—every device with a microchip was dead. The hospital had a few old mercury thermometers, a couple of manual sphygmomanometers, but not nearly enough. And the knowledge of how to practice medicine without technology had largely been forgotten. Younger doctors had never learned to diagnose by percussion and auscultation alone. They had been trained to order tests, to trust machines, to follow algorithmic protocols that assumed infinite access to imaging and bloodwork.

Medicine as it had been practiced a hundred years ago—with all the limitations and mortality rates that implied.

"Doctor Okonkwo?" A young resident, fresh from medical school, stood at his elbow. Her face was the particular shade of gray that indicated she was moments from either crying or vomiting. "There's a situation in the maternity ward."

"What kind of situation?"

"A woman in labor. The baby is breech. And we can't—" She gestured helplessly. "We can't do a C-section. Not safely. Not without—"

"Without anything," David finished. "I understand." He turned to Gloria. "Keep this one stable if you can. I'll be back."

He walked through the chaos of the ER, past patients on gurneys in the hallway, past families huddled against walls, past a security guard trying to maintain order with diminishing success. The walk seemed to take forever.

In the maternity ward, he found Dr. Amelia Foster—the hospital's senior obstetrician—standing over a patient with terror carefully masked by professionalism.

"I can attempt an external version," she said quietly. "Try to turn the baby. But if that doesn't work..."

David nodded. They both knew what "doesn't work" meant. What it had meant for most of human history, before surgical intervention became routine.

"Do what you can," he said. "I'll assist."

The woman on the bed—young, maybe twenty-five, her face slick with sweat—looked between them. "Is my baby going to be okay?"

David had been trained never to lie to patients. He had also been trained to provide comfort, to maintain hope.

Those two imperatives were, for the first time in his career, entirely irreconcilable.

"We're going to do everything we can," he said. It was true. It was also completely inadequate.

The woman began to cry. Her husband held her hand and stared at the doctors with eyes that begged for reassurance.

They had none to give.
